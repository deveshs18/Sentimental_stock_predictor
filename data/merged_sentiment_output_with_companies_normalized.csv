2025-06-20 16:17:36,Portugal PSI up 0.7%  But what really going on with GALP? Undervalued or overhyped?,"Just checked the Portugal market close  PSI20 gained a solid 0.71% with tech financials and telecom leading the charge. BCP Portugal Commercial Bank was the standout +3.6% pushing the index higher alongside Semapa and EDPR. Overall 19 stocks closed up, only 6 down, so broadbased strength for sure.

But then there GALP the perennial hot topic. The energy giant slid 1.6% on the day despite all the buzz about its undervalued status. I keep seeing those AIdriven picks hyping GALP as a sleeper with massive upside  but is that really the case? The stock has been on everyone radar for a while now, and yet it keeps lagging.

I get the logic energy sector volatility longterm transition risks and maybe some pipeline of projects that could pay off. But fundamentals haven‚Äôt really caught up and recent oil price softness isn‚Äôt helping. Plus the valuation looks stretched when you factor in EU energy policy uncertainty and competitive pressures.

Honestly it feels like GALP is that classic value trap a lot of folks want to believe in but keep getting burned on. The hype around AI models and hidden gems is cool, but I‚Äôm skeptical until I see some clear catalysts or actual earnings beats.

Meanwhile the broader PSI market looks healthier  financials and renewable energy names like EDPR are picking up steam which feels more sustainable.

What do you all think? Is GALP a true undervalued gem, or is it just noise riding the energy hype train?",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lg83ex/portugal_psi_up_07_but_what_really_going_on_with/,Alphabet Inc.¬†(Class A)

Both of these stocks are being impacted by the current political climate but they should be able to weather it out by next year. So far from what I've read, ELV is better than UNH in terms of performance, but they're also more dependent on medicaid than UNH. Would ELV be impacted in the future heavily? Since UNH is down greatly that makes their stock a discount currently, so I would argue they have better potential for growth. However I'm unsure that's the only thing to drag it back up.

* Keeping it simple and fundamentals-driven, no machine learning or black-box stuff

Looking to team up with people who:

* Enjoy forensic-style research and digging into 10-Ks
* Have a good nose for trouble in the numbers
* Might already have ideas or experience with short setups
* Are up for bouncing ideas around and working together informally

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

The project will cover the design, implementation and launch of the system, with AST SpaceMobile developing, manufacturing and managing the satellite constellation, while Vi will oversee terrestrial network integration, operational spectrum and market access.

Avneesh Khosla, Chief Marketing Officer, Vi, said, ""Vi has always been committed to connecting every Indian with technology and we see satellite communications as a complement to terrestrial connectivity. As satellite-based mobile access becomes a reality in India, we look forward to ushering in a new era of seamless and resilient connectivity.""

Chris Avery, Chief Commercial Officer, AST SpaceMobile, said: ""India, with its large and vibrant telecom market, is the ideal place to demonstrate how our space-based cellular broadband can seamlessly complement terrestrial networks. Not only are we expanding coverage, but we are also breaking down connectivity barriers and enabling everyday smartphones to access 4G and 5G networks directly from space. We are excited to join hands with Vodafone Idea to open up new possibilities for emergency response, disaster management, agriculture, distance learning and countless other applications that benefit from truly ubiquitous mobile broadband.""

The partnership will place India at the forefront of global innovation in space technology and will drive the development of connectivity use cases and¬†[applications.Vi](http://applications.vi/)¬†and AST SpaceMobile will also work together to develop commercial products for a variety of segments including consumer, enterprise and IoT.

The unhedged fund has a TER of 0.2% and hedged is 0.35%. The year to date the hedged fund has performed significantly better presumably due to the weaker dollar:

2025-06-19 18:54:42,$50k in CLBR Calls,"https://preview.redd.it/kyijjvdg9x7f1.png?width=2390&format=png&auto=webp&s=907bea8308e8e587646032ac419f9c6e6960f490

Alright regards, I'm back after mentally recovering from paper handing my TSLA puts on possibly the craziest timed DD ever right before Orange tragically dumped Enron (check out my profile if you wanna read through that clusterfuck). With help from my AI therapist, I've recovered and I've moved on to the next play.

Today's topic is CLBR: a right-wing SPAC merger taking GrabAGun public into the ticker PEW (think Star Wars like how those guns go pew pew, pretty dope) so grab a strong drink and sit down cuz we're gonna be comparing it to DJT and how CLBR is likely to mimic that merger but with extra regard strength.

**Status of CLBR merger:**  
CLBR just submitted their 3rd revision of the S-4 (form the SEC requires for mergers). I did a PDF comparison between the 2nd and 3rd revision. They didn't change much, mostly cosmetic stuff as well as some extra outlined risks the SEC probably asked for. The document looks pretty solid. Therefore, I believe it is extremely close to getting approved by the SEC. I estimate it could be as soon as tomorrow. If not tomorrow, definitely next week.

When the S-4 was approved in the DJT merger, DWAC (the sponsor company like how CLBR is the sponsor company for GrabAGun) jumped something like 14%. Not bad.

**What happens after S-4 approval?**  
The shareholders will schedule a date to vote on the merger (spoilers, they will vote yes). When this was announced in the DJT merger, stock fell like 7% ish. Then when the actual merge date was announced, it initially rose then fell something like 14% on the news.

If the same happens with CLBR this will likely be a great entry point for anyone that missed out on S-4 approval. I'm probably going to increase my position if this happens.

**What happens on merge date?**  
We all know what happened to DJT, it made a lot of lucky fucks very wealthy.

***The risk-reward here is just too good to pass up imo.***

**BONUS POINTS**  
That's right regards, I'm not done so grab another drink if you need it.

**Orange Jr.**  
He's directly involved in this merger. We all know how much that family loves to cause a good pump (and eventually dump).

**Financials**  
Unlike Truth Social at the time, GrabAGun is an actual profitable, positive cash flow company. That means that this merger is likely to benefit from both the **meme stock regards (us)** as well as **actual smart investors (not us/other people)**.

In other words, this merger is gonna have both **regard strength** and **fundamental strength**. I wish I could say the same about myself but unfortunately I'm only regard strength.

**Bank Policies**  
Banks are changing their policies with respect to getting involved with companies in the firearms business. And who caused this change? That's right, Mr. Orange Man himself.

Headline: ""Citigroup Reverses Its Firearms Policy Months After Trump Called Out U.S. Banks. Here‚Äôs What to Know""

Pretty good timing for a company like GrabAGun, especially considering Orange's son (Orange Jr.) is directly involved. I wonder what else he could say to pump the shit out of this?

**Wartime and Political Uncertainty**  
What do people buy when they think WW3 is about to drop harder than a Drake album? Guns.

**Kelly Reisdorf Added to Board of Directors**  
She's the CEO of USA Shooting, I see future revenue streams opening up with this.

**What my AI Therapist has to say after I told it to do hella research:**  
""VI. Strategic Conclusion for the Sophisticated Investor

The public offerings of DJT, PEW, and NMAX signal the maturation of a distinct and challenging asset class: the politically-branded meme stock. These investment vehicles are defined less by their products or financial statements and more by a powerful narrative that transcends business fundamentals, a reliance on a central political figurehead, and a dedicated base of retail investors who view their participation as an ideological act.

For DJT, the narrative *is* the product; its valuation is a direct reflection of sentiment surrounding Donald Trump, with little to no underlying business to support it. For NMAX, a similar political narrative combined with a low-float IPO structure fueled a brief but spectacular speculative frenzy. The pending PEW merger represents the next evolution of this model. Here, the political narrative serves as a powerful marketing wrapper and valuation accelerant for what appears to be a tangible, profitable underlying business.

The crucial takeaway for the sophisticated investor is the necessity of a dual-track analysis. Traditional fundamental analysis‚Äîevaluating revenue, profitability, cash flow, and competitive positioning‚Äîremains essential for understanding the long-term viability of the enterprise. However, it is insufficient on its own. It must be paired with an equally rigorous analysis of the political narrative's strength, the loyalty of the retail investor base, and the technical factors, like share float and lock-up periods, that can drive short-term volatility.

The interplay, and often the direct conflict, between these two value drivers‚Äîfundamental reality and political narrative‚Äîwill ultimately determine the stock's trajectory. Investing in these entities is not merely a bet on a company's success; it is a complex and high-risk wager on the direction, intensity, and durability of a political movement.""

**EDIT TO INCLUDE COMMENT:**  
Also worth mentioning: with this being firearms and Orange Jr.-related, there's bound to be some controversy. Especially if this gains traction. More news = more pump, especially if say Fox or NewsMax covers it and the rednecks start buying it up.

2025-06-19 15:27:57,Thoughts on investment strategy,"Hi everyone, 

I'm 39/m, living in Europe, with inherited US dollars in a Schwab international account, so I cannot invest in mutual funds or ETFs, only individual stocks and bonds. Initially I bought multiple US treasuries with various maturity dates from 2025-2032, just to avoid having to think about it. Then, about a year ago, I started investing 750$/month in 15 individual stocks via Schwab's ""stock slices"" service (so 50$ per stock per month), thus slowly increasing the stocks percentage as bonds start maturing and freeing cash. Since I can't just buy a S&P500-ETF, my idea was to represent it with these 15 stocks, focusing mostly on growth/tech, with a few defensive dividend positions as well, and avoiding big finance, fossile energy and defense industry (just personal preference). I'd be curious to hear what people think of my picks: 

Apple / Microsoft / Nvidia / Broadcom / Adobe / PaloAlto Networks / ServiceNow / Merck / Abbvie / Vertex Pharmaceuticals / Procter&Gamble / NextEra Energy / MainStreet Capital / Realty Income REIT / WasteManagement 

I realize scientifically speaking ""time in the market beats timing the market"", but I just feel more comfortable psychologically with the approach of slowly building the stock portion, as opposed to just buying lump sums of all these stocks at one random moment.

2025-06-19 14:40:11,Coreweave 9-19 $150 csps for 192k premium,"Wrote 30 crwv (coreweave) 9/19 $150 csps (cash secured puts) for $62/share premium and 1 crwv 9/19 $150 csp for $64.1/share premium. Max profit $192k, max loss if coreweave goes to 0 is $273k. The $192k premium and $465k ‚Äúcash‚Äù are in money market collecting 4 percent interest, which will yield another $6,700 between now and 9/19.

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:

‚ÄúThe general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies‚Äô collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.

Customers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.‚Äù

Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. 

Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. 

However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability. 

Best case scenario is that coreweave closes in the $150 range with high IV on 9/19 and I get to run it back again, while collecting more premium and interest.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfchc3,Analog Devices

2025-06-19 14:10:39,From Decentralized Hype to Centralized Risk: The Stablecoin Trap,"
The new stablecoin legislation that was pushed through the Senate this week effectively ties the U.S. Treasury to crypto, because nothing says ‚Äúsound fiscal footing‚Äù like betting the government‚Äôs cash flow on digital tokens and market hype. 

This new plan forces stablecoins to be backed by short-term T-bills. That creates an estimated $2‚Äì$3 trillion in new demand for government debt, which is nearly half the current size of the T-bill market. On paper, that looks like a win. In reality, it‚Äôs a circular feedback loop: Crypto demand fuels stablecoins, stablecoins buy T-bills, T-bills fund deficits. The government becomes addicted to speculative capital flows. And round and round we go.

It‚Äôll work great, until it doesn‚Äôt. The whole setup depends on risk appetite staying high. Thing is, crypto isn‚Äôt some stable, predictable pillar of the economy. It‚Äôs a sentiment-driven casino, where whales move markets and retail euphoria inflates bubbles. Confidence in that environment can evaporate overnight.

When the music stops, we will see a wave of stablecoin redemptions. To meet those redemptions, issuers have to dump T-bills into the open market. Yields will then spike and liquidity will dry up. Government borrowing costs jump at exactly the worst time. Suddenly, the entire short end of the Treasury curve is caught in a feedback loop running in reverse.

Crypto is becoming exactly what it claimed to replace: a systemic risk the government can‚Äôt afford to let fail. And it won‚Äôt be the VC whales or offshore exchanges who foot the bill. It‚Äôll be the taxpayers, either directly or through backdoor rescues and Fed liquidity if things unravel.

Once you tie public finance to crypto flows, the line between a market correction and a fiscal crisis starts to blur. A major stablecoin unwind won‚Äôt just hit DeFi yield chasers, it‚Äôll slam the short end of the Treasury market. That‚Äôs when the Fed and Treasury will have no choice but to step in, to stabilize yields, backstop liquidity, and calm foreign holders.

So yeah, we‚Äôre already halfway to a too-big-to-fail bailout economy for crypto. Not because it earned that privilege, but because we let it entangle itself in the core plumbing of the financial system.

This isn‚Äôt just risky, it‚Äôs desperate. You don‚Äôt latch public finances to speculative manias unless you‚Äôre out of conventional tools. And if your fiscal strategy depends on token demand holding up, you‚Äôve already lost the plot.

What makes this even more dangerous is the moral hazard baked in. We‚Äôre handing fiscal stability to unregulated private actors, namely stablecoin issuers, hedge funds, and crypto exchanges, many of whom have no oversight and no skin in the game if it blows up. Just like the shadow banks in 2008, they profit on the way up and vanish when the tide goes out.

They‚Äôre calling this ‚Äúfinancial innovation,‚Äù and anyone who questions it a Luddite. But let‚Äôs be clear: this isn‚Äôt modernization. It‚Äôs monetizing the mania and papering over structural deficits by plugging them into whatever speculative engine happens to be hot this cycle.

If this goes sideways, and history says it eventually will, it won‚Äôt just hurt crypto. It could shake global trust in U.S. debt markets, and by extension, the dollar itself. Because now our ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù assets are being propped up by the same forces that gave us meme coins and NFT rug pulls. That‚Äôs how systems collapse, not with one catastrophic decision, but with a series of reckless bets made under the illusion that the good times will last forever.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lfbs8t/from_decentralized_hype_to_centralized_risk_the/,Analog Devices

I swear half my losses came from indicators that need a week to tell me what happened yesterday. By the time they ""confirm"" anything, the real money's already been made by someone else.

The whole thing is backwards. These indicators use moving averages - they're literally designed to be slow. Waiting for pivot confirmations, crossing signals, divergence ""proof""... meanwhile the stock's already moved 10%.

I have been working on reading momentum differently. Instead of averaged prices over X periods, just watching the actual fight between buyers and sellers as it happens. Like, are buyers getting exhausted RIGHT NOW, not 5 bars from now.

NVDA at $95 was a perfect example. Every traditional indicator said ""wait for confirmation."" But the real-time action was screaming that sellers were done. Next thing you know it's at $145.

That 52% move? Most of it happened while traditional indicators were still ""waiting for confirmation.""

Same story everywhere - SPX reversals, individual stocks, commodities. The exhaustion shows up immediately if you know what to look for. Not after the fact, not next week, but right when it matters.

I had a taxable account in college because I did not earn enough to pay capital gains taxes. The plan was to invest in that, sell right before I got a job incurring no taxes and just reinvest. I ended up having to use the money so not sure if this would have worked. 

As far as I can tell an even bigger loophole if you have a lot in a taxable account is just to take 1 year off work, earn no income or just below the threshold, cash out and with income below the threshold pay no taxes on the gains? 

This also seems like a loophole with retirement making a taxable account functionally a Roth IRA? Could you not just in your first year of retirement with 0 income to report, withdraw all the money from your taxable account tax free?

2025-06-18 22:45:21,Gene-Editing Stocks Gain on LLY-VERV Deal Announcement,"Eli Lilly‚Äôs recent announcement to acquire Verve Therapeutics, Inc, a Boston-based clinical-stage company developing genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease, has put the spotlight on other promising companies developing gene therapies.

Post this acquisition, Lilly will add Verve‚Äôs pipeline of gene therapies targeting heart diseases. This includes VERVE-102, an investigational in vivo gene-editing therapy aimed at reducing cholesterol levels.

The share price of other gene-editing companies like Crispr Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics rallied following the announcement. Other companies in this space like Beam Therapeutics were also up. However, share price of Editas Medicine pared most of the gains recorded during the day and ended the session in red.

A Look at Promising Gene-Editing Companies

The rapid evolution of genomics, the study of genes and their functions in recent times has paved the way for a revolutionary era in genetic medicine.

Gene-editing companies hold potential to treat and cure diseases caused by genetic variants. As the name suggests, they make changes or correct defects in the organism's DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a breakthrough in the development of genome editing approaches.

Shares of NTLA were up 6.9% on June 17 on investor optimism about its prospects. Intellia Therapeutics is a clinical-stage gene editing company, focused on developing drugs with CRISPR-based therapies. NTLA is leveraging its modular platform to advance in vivo and ex vivo therapies for diseases with high unmet need.

NTLA‚Äôs leads in vivo product candidates are nex-z for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and NTLA-2002 for the treatment of hereditary angioedema.

CRISPR Therapeutics is rapidly leveraging its CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform to develop therapies for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies, cancer, diabetes and other diseases. Shares of CRSP were up 3.9% on June 17. CRISPR Therapeutics achieved a milestone in November 2023, when it received the first-ever authorization/approval for a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy under the trade name Casgevy. CRSP has collaborated with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals for Casgevy.

Meanwhile, BEAM is advancing a broad, diversified portfolio of base editing programs against distinct, genetically validated editing targets.  The company is currently developing BEAM-101 for sickle cell disease (SCD). The FDA recently granted orphan drug designation to BEAM-101 for SCD.

Editas Medicine is a clinical-stage genome editing biotech developing treatment using its proprietary genome editing platform based on the unique CRISPR technology. The company is currently focusing on in vivo (within the living organism) pipeline development.

Focus on M&A in 2025

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) have picked up significant pace in 2025 in the pharma/biotech sector after a passive run in 2024. The recent spree of acquisitions signifies a focus on portfolio expansion and constant pipeline innovation amid the recent tariff threat.

While oncology and immuno-oncology companies have always been at the top of acquisition targets, the lucrative obesity sector and gene-editing space are also being eyed.

Pharma giant Sanofi recently announced that it will acquire Blueprint Medicines for a total deal value of up to $9.5 billion to expand its portfolio in rare immunological disease and add an early-stage pipeline in immunology. The impending acquisition will add Blueprint Medicines‚Äô only marketed product, Ayvakit (avapritinib), an inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA proteins, to Sanofi‚Äôs commercial portfolio.

In April, pharma giant Johnson & Johnson acquired Intra-Cellular Therapies for approximately $14.6 billion and added antidepressant drug, Caplyta, to its neuroscience portfolio.

Swiss pharma bigwig Novartis, too, has been on an acquisition spree.  Novartis is all set to acquire San Diego-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Regulus Therapeutics to strengthen its renal disease portfolio.

As M&A momentum accelerates across the gene-editing and biotech landscape, stocks like CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, BGM, EXEL, and ARWR may stand to benefit from renewed investor interest and potential strategic partnerships.

M&A activity is expected to accelerate further in 2025, given the massive cash reserve owned by major pharma and biotech companies and intensifying pressure from investors to diversify business.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1leuykb/geneediting_stocks_gain_on_llyverv_deal/,Analog Devices

* Unusual News Volume Factor: 6x its normal. 
* **Stock Reaction: +0.33% today | -0.71% over 5D.** 

News Highlights:  
Texas Instruments (TXN) has announced a sweeping $60 billion commitment to expand its domestic semiconductor operations marking what it calls the largest investment in foundational chip manufacturing in U.S. history.

The investment will fund the construction or expansion of seven chip fabrication plants across three sites in Texas and Utah, including two new facilities in Sherman, TX. The company estimates the initiative will create up to 60,000 jobs across the supply chain and construction ecosystem.

Back in August 2024, TI had outlined a roadmap to build out seven fabs, with projected spending of $40 billion in Sherman and an additional $21 billion across its Utah and other Texas sites. This week's announcement formalizes that vision while slightly increasing the total budget.

The company is aggressively ramping up in-house manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on overseas supply chains and counter the rise of Chinese analog chip competitors. The effort aligns with broader U.S. policy initiatives to reshore critical technology production.

While no detailed timeline was disclosed, Texas Instruments noted that the capital will be allocated over multiple years, with approximately $46 billion earmarked for Texas and $15 billion for Utah. TI emphasized that its long-term capital expenditure plan remains consistent, underscoring a strategic rather than reactive expansion.

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Alphabet‚Äôs self-driving car unit announced on Wednesday that it plans to drive vehicles manually in New York, marking the first step toward potentially cracking the largest U.S. city. Waymo said it applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel in Manhattan.

‚ÄúWhile we won‚Äôt be in New York full-time yet, we have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future,‚Äù the company said in an announcement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working towards that goal in a few key ways.‚Äù

If the permit is granted, it would be the city‚Äôs first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles.¬†New York state law currently prohibits a service like Waymo to operate without a driver.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel,‚Äù the company said.

Meanwhile, Waymo is aggressively expanding into new U.S. markets. Waymo One, its ride-hailing service, provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas, and is preparing to bring fully autonomous rides to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., in 2026.

Waymo has made a prior appearance in New York.

The company brought its cars to¬†parts¬†of the city in 2021 for manual driving, data collection and testing. Ethan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, said ‚Äúit was a planned trip with a start and an end.‚Äù The testing allowed Waymo to improve driving in icy and snowy conditions in a densely populated area, the company said.

More generally, I‚Äôve been thinking-- Even if a business / stock has a great 5-10 year outlook, it might become obsolete in 20-30 years. Of course, you could sell the stock when the outlook turns negative, but then you're paying CG taxes (i.e., it's no longer a long-term / retirement investment). 

So my question is: How do you take into consideration the loooong-term / ""end-life‚Äù of a stock when investing for retirement?

I think I was just trying to root for the underdog and hope that AMD would catch up to Nvidia and then their stock would skyrocket. But it's pretty clear now that that isn't going to happen. Would it be a good idea to sell half of my AMD shares and reinvest the proceeds into Nvidia stock to diversify? That way, if Nvidia continues to pop off, I will be able to enjoy some profit from that instead of continuously feeling disappointed that AMD is underperforming. Or should I stick to my guns and just keep investing in AMD?",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1legpat/should_i_sell_half_of_my_amd_shares_and_invest/,Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

Seems like Buffett stepping down has created some concern. To be fair it has still impressively outperformed the S&P YTD, but the sharp selling pressure makes me wonder about the short to midterm future. To be clear I don't currently have a position am doing a bit more research before I make a decision.

2025-06-17 22:27:24,Microsoft & AMD team up on next gen Xbox chips  what does this mean for Nvidia and Sony?,"Big news just dropped  Microsoft and AMD just announced a multi-year partnership to develop custom chips for the next wave of Xbox console  from in-home to handhelds

This comes right after Microsoft showed off their new handhelds (Xbox Ally and Ally X) with ASUS. Seems like they‚Äôre going all-in on mobile gaming and cloud-based access. Sarah Bond even mentioned AI-enhanced visuals and full backward compatibility

AMD already has deep ties with both Xbox and PlayStation. But now with this new exclusive push, is Microsoft trying to build an ecosystem like Apple  where hardware, software  and cloud all sync seamlessly?

Also how does this play out for Nvidia, who powers Nintendo's Switch line? And what‚Äôs Sony‚Äôs move here, especially after letting Xbox publish games on PlayStation?

Game Pass is already pulling in strong growth and Xbox‚Äôs segment posted $13B+ last quarter. If Microsoft nails the hardware side too is this where the next leg of growth comes from?",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1le0uqf/microsoft_amd_team_up_on_next_gen_xbox_chips_what/,Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

Tariff Risk: Trump's comments suggest he could unilaterally impose tariffs or expand tariffs on EU auto and pharmaceutical imports, and possibly even impose more tariffs - a move that has historically devastated related stock groups  
  
Sector exposure: Watch autos (GM, F, TSLA), large-cap pharma (PFE, MRK) and industrials (CAT, GE) for increased volatility  
  
Market sentiment: Despite Middle East tensions, major indices barely flinched on Monday, but a fresh bout of trade uncertainty could undermine recent gains
