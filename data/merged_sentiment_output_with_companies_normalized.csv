2025-06-19 18:57:43,I’m in the U.S.-my company is global and headquartered/publicly traded in Europe.  They are offering U.S. employees a stock purchase program,"Just to start off, I will say that the only stock that I currently own is in my 401(k). I have never owned or traded stocks directly. I am relatively new with this company, but just sat through a webinar about their stock purchase program.  There are two programs, one is essentially a guaranteed return which has a floor and a “performance payment” should the stock lose value. The second is just a straight full risk purchase.  Participants will get a 15% discount off of the reference price and a company match up to a certain amount.  I am inclined to purchase some stock under the guaranteed return program and some stock under the full risk program (we are permitted to do so), but I’m wondering, is it not otherwise possible for an individual in the U.S. to buy stock in a foreign company?  Just curious.  Obviously buying under this program has its advantages in the form of the discount and the match which I would not get just buying on the open market assuming I could even do so.

2025-06-19 18:54:42,$50k in CLBR Calls,"https://preview.redd.it/kyijjvdg9x7f1.png?width=2390&format=png&auto=webp&s=907bea8308e8e587646032ac419f9c6e6960f490

Alright regards, I'm back after mentally recovering from paper handing my TSLA puts on possibly the craziest timed DD ever right before Orange tragically dumped Enron (check out my profile if you wanna read through that clusterfuck). With help from my AI therapist, I've recovered and I've moved on to the next play.

Today's topic is CLBR: a right-wing SPAC merger taking GrabAGun public into the ticker PEW (think Star Wars like how those guns go pew pew, pretty dope) so grab a strong drink and sit down cuz we're gonna be comparing it to DJT and how CLBR is likely to mimic that merger but with extra regard strength.

**Status of CLBR merger:**  
CLBR just submitted their 3rd revision of the S-4 (form the SEC requires for mergers). I did a PDF comparison between the 2nd and 3rd revision. They didn't change much, mostly cosmetic stuff as well as some extra outlined risks the SEC probably asked for. The document looks pretty solid. Therefore, I believe it is extremely close to getting approved by the SEC. I estimate it could be as soon as tomorrow. If not tomorrow, definitely next week.

When the S-4 was approved in the DJT merger, DWAC (the sponsor company like how CLBR is the sponsor company for GrabAGun) jumped something like 14%. Not bad.

**What happens after S-4 approval?**  
The shareholders will schedule a date to vote on the merger (spoilers, they will vote yes). When this was announced in the DJT merger, stock fell like 7% ish. Then when the actual merge date was announced, it initially rose then fell something like 14% on the news.

If the same happens with CLBR this will likely be a great entry point for anyone that missed out on S-4 approval. I'm probably going to increase my position if this happens.

**What happens on merge date?**  
We all know what happened to DJT, it made a lot of lucky fucks very wealthy.

***The risk-reward here is just too good to pass up imo.***

**BONUS POINTS**  
That's right regards, I'm not done so grab another drink if you need it.

**Orange Jr.**  
He's directly involved in this merger. We all know how much that family loves to cause a good pump (and eventually dump).

**Financials**  
Unlike Truth Social at the time, GrabAGun is an actual profitable, positive cash flow company. That means that this merger is likely to benefit from both the **meme stock regards (us)** as well as **actual smart investors (not us/other people)**.

In other words, this merger is gonna have both **regard strength** and **fundamental strength**. I wish I could say the same about myself but unfortunately I'm only regard strength.

**Bank Policies**  
Banks are changing their policies with respect to getting involved with companies in the firearms business. And who caused this change? That's right, Mr. Orange Man himself.

Headline: ""Citigroup Reverses Its Firearms Policy Months After Trump Called Out U.S. Banks. Here’s What to Know""

Pretty good timing for a company like GrabAGun, especially considering Orange's son (Orange Jr.) is directly involved. I wonder what else he could say to pump the shit out of this?

**Wartime and Political Uncertainty**  
What do people buy when they think WW3 is about to drop harder than a Drake album? Guns.

**Kelly Reisdorf Added to Board of Directors**  
She's the CEO of USA Shooting, I see future revenue streams opening up with this.

**What my AI Therapist has to say after I told it to do hella research:**  
""VI. Strategic Conclusion for the Sophisticated Investor

The public offerings of DJT, PEW, and NMAX signal the maturation of a distinct and challenging asset class: the politically-branded meme stock. These investment vehicles are defined less by their products or financial statements and more by a powerful narrative that transcends business fundamentals, a reliance on a central political figurehead, and a dedicated base of retail investors who view their participation as an ideological act.

For DJT, the narrative *is* the product; its valuation is a direct reflection of sentiment surrounding Donald Trump, with little to no underlying business to support it. For NMAX, a similar political narrative combined with a low-float IPO structure fueled a brief but spectacular speculative frenzy. The pending PEW merger represents the next evolution of this model. Here, the political narrative serves as a powerful marketing wrapper and valuation accelerant for what appears to be a tangible, profitable underlying business.

The crucial takeaway for the sophisticated investor is the necessity of a dual-track analysis. Traditional fundamental analysis—evaluating revenue, profitability, cash flow, and competitive positioning—remains essential for understanding the long-term viability of the enterprise. However, it is insufficient on its own. It must be paired with an equally rigorous analysis of the political narrative's strength, the loyalty of the retail investor base, and the technical factors, like share float and lock-up periods, that can drive short-term volatility.

The interplay, and often the direct conflict, between these two value drivers—fundamental reality and political narrative—will ultimately determine the stock's trajectory. Investing in these entities is not merely a bet on a company's success; it is a complex and high-risk wager on the direction, intensity, and durability of a political movement.""

**EDIT TO INCLUDE COMMENT:**  
Also worth mentioning: with this being firearms and Orange Jr.-related, there's bound to be some controversy. Especially if this gains traction. More news = more pump, especially if say Fox or NewsMax covers it and the rednecks start buying it up.

It’s the first time Amazon has ever disclosed a stake in the semiconductor company. It also happened to be the only new position in their entire portfolio last quarter.

At the time of the filing, AMD’s stock was down \~6% YTD while the broader chip sector was almost flat. Then, just one week after the 13F dropped, AMD announced a $6B stock buyback boosting its total repurchase capacity to $10B. This came right after unveiling a $10B AI partnership with Saudi-backed startup Humain, which is building Arabic LLMs and data center infrastructure across the Middle East.

Amazon’s cloud division, AWS, already uses AMD’s EPYC chips in some of its instances. With Nvidia supply tight and AMD pushing its MI300X AI accelerators, the move might hint at deeper strategic alignment. It’s also possible Amazon wanted to lock in a chip partner for its growing AI infrastructure push especially as it faces off with Microsoft and Google.

2025-06-19 15:27:57,Thoughts on investment strategy,"Hi everyone, 

I'm 39/m, living in Europe, with inherited US dollars in a Schwab international account, so I cannot invest in mutual funds or ETFs, only individual stocks and bonds. Initially I bought multiple US treasuries with various maturity dates from 2025-2032, just to avoid having to think about it. Then, about a year ago, I started investing 750$/month in 15 individual stocks via Schwab's ""stock slices"" service (so 50$ per stock per month), thus slowly increasing the stocks percentage as bonds start maturing and freeing cash. Since I can't just buy a S&P500-ETF, my idea was to represent it with these 15 stocks, focusing mostly on growth/tech, with a few defensive dividend positions as well, and avoiding big finance, fossile energy and defense industry (just personal preference). I'd be curious to hear what people think of my picks: 

Apple / Microsoft / Nvidia / Broadcom / Adobe / PaloAlto Networks / ServiceNow / Merck / Abbvie / Vertex Pharmaceuticals / Procter&Gamble / NextEra Energy / MainStreet Capital / Realty Income REIT / WasteManagement

Max profit $192k, max loss if coreweave goes to 0 is $273k. The $192k premium and $465k “cash” are in money market collecting 4 percent interest, which will yield another $6,700 between now and 9/19.

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:

“The general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies’ collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.

Customers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.”

Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. 

Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. 

However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability.

2025-06-19 14:10:39,From Decentralized Hype to Centralized Risk: The Stablecoin Trap,"
The new stablecoin legislation that was pushed through the Senate this week effectively ties the U.S. Treasury to crypto, because nothing says “sound fiscal footing” like betting the government’s cash flow on digital tokens and market hype. 

This new plan forces stablecoins to be backed by short-term T-bills. That creates an estimated $2–$3 trillion in new demand for government debt, which is nearly half the current size of the T-bill market. On paper, that looks like a win. In reality, it’s a circular feedback loop: Crypto demand fuels stablecoins, stablecoins buy T-bills, T-bills fund deficits. The government becomes addicted to speculative capital flows. And round and round we go.

It’ll work great, until it doesn’t. The whole setup depends on risk appetite staying high. Thing is, crypto isn’t some stable, predictable pillar of the economy. It’s a sentiment-driven casino, where whales move markets and retail euphoria inflates bubbles. Confidence in that environment can evaporate overnight.

When the music stops, we will see a wave of stablecoin redemptions. To meet those redemptions, issuers have to dump T-bills into the open market. Yields will then spike and liquidity will dry up. Government borrowing costs jump at exactly the worst time. Suddenly, the entire short end of the Treasury curve is caught in a feedback loop running in reverse.

Crypto is becoming exactly what it claimed to replace: a systemic risk the government can’t afford to let fail. And it won’t be the VC whales or offshore exchanges who foot the bill. It’ll be the taxpayers, either directly or through backdoor rescues and Fed liquidity if things unravel.

Once you tie public finance to crypto flows, the line between a market correction and a fiscal crisis starts to blur. A major stablecoin unwind won’t just hit DeFi yield chasers, it’ll slam the short end of the Treasury market. That’s when the Fed and Treasury will have no choice but to step in, to stabilize yields, backstop liquidity, and calm foreign holders.

So yeah, we’re already halfway to a too-big-to-fail bailout economy for crypto. Not because it earned that privilege, but because we let it entangle itself in the core plumbing of the financial system.

This isn’t just risky, it’s desperate. You don’t latch public finances to speculative manias unless you’re out of conventional tools. And if your fiscal strategy depends on token demand holding up, you’ve already lost the plot.

What makes this even more dangerous is the moral hazard baked in. We’re handing fiscal stability to unregulated private actors, namely stablecoin issuers, hedge funds, and crypto exchanges, many of whom have no oversight and no skin in the game if it blows up. Just like the shadow banks in 2008, they profit on the way up and vanish when the tide goes out.

They’re calling this “financial innovation,” and anyone who questions it a Luddite. But let’s be clear: this isn’t modernization. It’s monetizing the mania and papering over structural deficits by plugging them into whatever speculative engine happens to be hot this cycle.

If this goes sideways, and history says it eventually will, it won’t just hurt crypto. It could shake global trust in U.S. debt markets, and by extension, the dollar itself. Because now our “risk-free” assets are being propped up by the same forces that gave us meme coins and NFT rug pulls. That’s how systems collapse, not with one catastrophic decision, but with a series of reckless bets made under the illusion that the good times will last forever.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lfbs8t/from_decentralized_hype_to_centralized_risk_the/,Analog Devices

I swear half my losses came from indicators that need a week to tell me what happened yesterday. By the time they ""confirm"" anything, the real money's already been made by someone else.

The whole thing is backwards. These indicators use moving averages - they're literally designed to be slow. Waiting for pivot confirmations, crossing signals, divergence ""proof""... meanwhile the stock's already moved 10%.

I have been working on reading momentum differently. Instead of averaged prices over X periods, just watching the actual fight between buyers and sellers as it happens. Like, are buyers getting exhausted RIGHT NOW, not 5 bars from now.

NVDA at $95 was a perfect example. Every traditional indicator said ""wait for confirmation."" But the real-time action was screaming that sellers were done. Next thing you know it's at $145.

That 52% move? Most of it happened while traditional indicators were still ""waiting for confirmation.""

Same story everywhere - SPX reversals, individual stocks, commodities. The exhaustion shows up immediately if you know what to look for. Not after the fact, not next week, but right when it matters.

2025-06-19 13:11:41,How do long term capital gains income tax brackets work?,"Iv seen the brackets and this seems simple enough but there seems to be some loopholes and I’m not sure how they are handled.

I had a taxable account in college because I did not earn enough to pay capital gains taxes. The plan was to invest in that, sell right before I got a job incurring no taxes and just reinvest. I ended up having to use the money so not sure if this would have worked. 

As far as I can tell an even bigger loophole if you have a lot in a taxable account is just to take 1 year off work, earn no income or just below the threshold, cash out and with income below the threshold pay no taxes on the gains? 

This also seems like a loophole with retirement making a taxable account functionally a Roth IRA? Could you not just in your first year of retirement with 0 income to report, withdraw all the money from your taxable account tax free?

There’s a surprising range depending on location and land use, some geared toward recreation, others with development or timber value.

Then there’s a 20-acre property in Georgia around $95K that’s already cleared and has road access, which feels like a safer hold. They also had a 300+ acre hunting tract in Mississippi for over $800K, which is way out of my budget but interesting from a land portfolio angle.

I’m mostly focused on under-$200K properties with potential appreciation or light use (timber, lease, etc). Anyone here already investing in rural land?

2025-06-18 22:45:21,Gene-Editing Stocks Gain on LLY-VERV Deal Announcement,"Eli Lilly’s recent announcement to acquire Verve Therapeutics, Inc, a Boston-based clinical-stage company developing genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease, has put the spotlight on other promising companies developing gene therapies.

Post this acquisition, Lilly will add Verve’s pipeline of gene therapies targeting heart diseases. This includes VERVE-102, an investigational in vivo gene-editing therapy aimed at reducing cholesterol levels.

The share price of other gene-editing companies like Crispr Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics rallied following the announcement. Other companies in this space like Beam Therapeutics were also up. However, share price of Editas Medicine pared most of the gains recorded during the day and ended the session in red.

A Look at Promising Gene-Editing Companies

The rapid evolution of genomics, the study of genes and their functions in recent times has paved the way for a revolutionary era in genetic medicine.

Gene-editing companies hold potential to treat and cure diseases caused by genetic variants. As the name suggests, they make changes or correct defects in the organism's DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a breakthrough in the development of genome editing approaches.

Shares of NTLA were up 6.9% on June 17 on investor optimism about its prospects. Intellia Therapeutics is a clinical-stage gene editing company, focused on developing drugs with CRISPR-based therapies. NTLA is leveraging its modular platform to advance in vivo and ex vivo therapies for diseases with high unmet need.

NTLA’s leads in vivo product candidates are nex-z for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and NTLA-2002 for the treatment of hereditary angioedema.

CRISPR Therapeutics is rapidly leveraging its CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform to develop therapies for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies, cancer, diabetes and other diseases. Shares of CRSP were up 3.9% on June 17. CRISPR Therapeutics achieved a milestone in November 2023, when it received the first-ever authorization/approval for a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy under the trade name Casgevy. CRSP has collaborated with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals for Casgevy.

Meanwhile, BEAM is advancing a broad, diversified portfolio of base editing programs against distinct, genetically validated editing targets.  The company is currently developing BEAM-101 for sickle cell disease (SCD). The FDA recently granted orphan drug designation to BEAM-101 for SCD.

Editas Medicine is a clinical-stage genome editing biotech developing treatment using its proprietary genome editing platform based on the unique CRISPR technology. The company is currently focusing on in vivo (within the living organism) pipeline development.

Focus on M&A in 2025

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) have picked up significant pace in 2025 in the pharma/biotech sector after a passive run in 2024. The recent spree of acquisitions signifies a focus on portfolio expansion and constant pipeline innovation amid the recent tariff threat.

While oncology and immuno-oncology companies have always been at the top of acquisition targets, the lucrative obesity sector and gene-editing space are also being eyed.

Pharma giant Sanofi recently announced that it will acquire Blueprint Medicines for a total deal value of up to $9.5 billion to expand its portfolio in rare immunological disease and add an early-stage pipeline in immunology. The impending acquisition will add Blueprint Medicines’ only marketed product, Ayvakit (avapritinib), an inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA proteins, to Sanofi’s commercial portfolio.

In April, pharma giant Johnson & Johnson acquired Intra-Cellular Therapies for approximately $14.6 billion and added antidepressant drug, Caplyta, to its neuroscience portfolio.

Swiss pharma bigwig Novartis, too, has been on an acquisition spree.  Novartis is all set to acquire San Diego-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Regulus Therapeutics to strengthen its renal disease portfolio.

As M&A momentum accelerates across the gene-editing and biotech landscape, stocks like CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, BGM, EXEL, and ARWR may stand to benefit from renewed investor interest and potential strategic partnerships.

M&A activity is expected to accelerate further in 2025, given the massive cash reserve owned by major pharma and biotech companies and intensifying pressure from investors to diversify business.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1leuykb/geneediting_stocks_gain_on_llyverv_deal/,Analog Devices

* *""Texas Instruments plans to invest over $60 billion in US to make foundational chips""*  \- Reuters, Bloomberg. 
* Unusual News Volume Factor: 6x its normal. 
* **Stock Reaction: +0.33% today | -0.71% over 5D.** 

News Highlights:  
Texas Instruments (TXN) has announced a sweeping $60 billion commitment to expand its domestic semiconductor operations marking what it calls the largest investment in foundational chip manufacturing in U.S. history.

The investment will fund the construction or expansion of seven chip fabrication plants across three sites in Texas and Utah, including two new facilities in Sherman, TX. The company estimates the initiative will create up to 60,000 jobs across the supply chain and construction ecosystem.

Back in August 2024, TI had outlined a roadmap to build out seven fabs, with projected spending of $40 billion in Sherman and an additional $21 billion across its Utah and other Texas sites. This week's announcement formalizes that vision while slightly increasing the total budget.

The company is aggressively ramping up in-house manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on overseas supply chains and counter the rise of Chinese analog chip competitors. The effort aligns with broader U.S. policy initiatives to reshore critical technology production.

While no detailed timeline was disclosed, Texas Instruments noted that the capital will be allocated over multiple years, with approximately $46 billion earmarked for Texas and $15 billion for Utah. TI emphasized that its long-term capital expenditure plan remains consistent, underscoring a strategic rather than reactive expansion.

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Is MSFT losing strategic leverage here? Or are they just protecting their current ROI？Could this open the door for Google, Amazon, or even Meta to get in bed with OpenAI?How would a fractured OpenAI impact Azure’s AI moat vs AWS and GCP?MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity

They have low % change because I just bought back after selling it all on Monday after big gains.

DD

Firstly, people love to hate on OKLO and call it overpriced, when it will easily be $100+ when they start producing based on all the contracts they signed and the energy they will sell, which is absolutely genius to do. Their tech isn’t just making SMRs because they aren’t the only ones, the smart part is selling the energy itself making it an even safer process. Speaking of safety,

Nuclear is the second safest energy production method after only hydro, by death rate.

Its also insanely cheap after it starts producing, and much more reliable than ones that take less like wind or solar.

It’s also very clean, even when compared to so called clean options like solar, which arguably cause even greater damage to the environment because of all the cobalt and other minerals that they require to build batteries and other parts, extracted from the horrible mines in Congo. 

People might be thinking it’s too late, after the boom which came since liberation day. But it’s really far from over. Uranium prices are only at 75, and they’ve been higher than 100 a few years ago. 

It doesn’t matter if you chose a start up like OKLO, or if you chose an established company like Cameco. OKLO and cameco are at their ATH, and cameco has been publicly traded for nearly 30 years already, still growing.

Also, June is normally a slow month in this sector and it’s doing great, just wait for the better months!

2025-06-18 16:26:06,"Waymo cars are coming to New York, but with a driver behind the wheel","Residents of New York City will soon start seeing Waymo cars cruising the avenues. But at least for now, a human will be in the driver’s seat.

Alphabet’s self-driving car unit announced on Wednesday that it plans to drive vehicles manually in New York, marking the first step toward potentially cracking the largest U.S. city. Waymo said it applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel in Manhattan.

“While we won’t be in New York full-time yet, we have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future,” the company said in an announcement. “We’re working towards that goal in a few key ways.”

If the permit is granted, it would be the city’s first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles. New York state law currently prohibits a service like Waymo to operate without a driver.

“We’re advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel,” the company said.

Meanwhile, Waymo is aggressively expanding into new U.S. markets. Waymo One, its ride-hailing service, provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas, and is preparing to bring fully autonomous rides to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., in 2026.

Waymo has made a prior appearance in New York.

The company brought its cars to parts of the city in 2021 for manual driving, data collection and testing. Ethan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, said “it was a planned trip with a start and an end.” The testing allowed Waymo to improve driving in icy and snowy conditions in a densely populated area, the company said.

2025-06-18 16:13:04,Is it a good idea to put $100K in SCHD in my taxable brokerage account,"For context, I’ve already maxed out my Roth IRA for the year (which I do every year) and I contribute regularly to my 401k through work. I currently have about $100K sitting in a HYSA and I’m thinking about moving it into SCHD in my taxable brokerage account.

My goal is to collect dividends every quarter and reinvest them. Eventually, I’d love to use the passive income to help pay for things like rent or even the occasional vacation.

The issue is everyone keeps telling me it’s a bad idea because of taxes and that I shouldn’t focus so much on dividends. But I’m not sure what a better move would be. I don’t want to leave that much cash just sitting in a HYSA long-term and the Roth IRA contribution limit is around 6 thousand I believe.

If you were in my shoes, where would you park this money? Would SCHD really be such a bad idea?

This is also a record stock buyback period which has kept tech stocks stable. AI stocks are a no brainer for many and the second factor to keep tech stocks up and stable. 

The dollar degradation has also caused the USD value of a US traded stock remain stable as USD itself degrades in value. 

The P/E ratios for the broad market are stretched, and yet capital keeps flowing in due to FOMO. It's like standing on what feels like solid ground, but in reality, the sea floor is dropping and no one knows how far down it goes. 

Caution is needed, because the crash may not happen tomorrow, but there is a huge disconnect from fundamentals in this market. The reason bubbles burst and don't just deflate is because reality hits hard.

2025-06-18 14:56:00,How do you factor a stock's “end life” into your long-term holdings?,"(Sorry if this is a naive question.) FYI I’m investing for long-term / retirement. I own some tech stocks that have done very well, but it’s got me thinking: “will these companies still be relevant / valuable when I retire in 20-30 years?"" For example, look at Intel: they were King a decade+ ago, and now they’re down 65% since 5 years ago. Were people short-sighted to include Intel in their retirement portfolio?

More generally, I’ve been thinking-- Even if a business / stock has a great 5-10 year outlook, it might become obsolete in 20-30 years. Of course, you could sell the stock when the outlook turns negative, but then you're paying CG taxes (i.e., it's no longer a long-term / retirement investment). 

So my question is: How do you take into consideration the loooong-term / ""end-life” of a stock when investing for retirement? Do you only include stocks that seem “timeless” in your retirement portfolio? Or do you just diversify enough to hedge against a few stocks losing the bulk of their value at some point in the long-term? Or do you just assume that you’ll sell a stock before the downturn, eat the CG tax, and move it into another stock with a solid 5-10 year outlook?

Management would be wise at this point to focus less on stock buybacks and more on effectively investing cash flow into more aggressive M&A and better R&D talent. I predict Apple stock will return 10% annually over the next 12 months. I also predict Apple will return 10% annually over the next 10 years as well.

AAPL has been relatively weak so far in 2025. As of June 17, shares were trading at $195.64, down $2.83 intraday (-1.43%) Cumulatively, the year-to-date decline is about 20%, making it one of the worst-performing tech giants in MAG7

In the last month, the stock price has oscillated between $196 and $202 since the end of May, and is still below the key 50-day SMA of $205.69 and the 200-day SMA of $225.74, indicating that medium- to long-term downward pressure still exists.From a fundamental standpoint, Apple achieved revenue of $95.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up 5% year-over-year Diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, both of which exceeded Wall Street's expectations

can be considered to take a small position in the low batch of buying, using the average support area for short-term rebound arbitrage. If AAPL falls to $193-190, you can consider taking small positions to buy in low batches and take advantage of the SMA support area for short-term rebound arbitrage.

So, followup question. As my RMD from my 403b will be here soon ( I'm 71) and we are both still working with a combined annual income of 211K  with no overhead other than a 20K mortgage which will be gone in 2 years if not paid off early, it's definitely not needed. Currently around 50K in savings.

Myself, earning 91K , social security 27K, small pension from 1970 job - $2,500 ( that seemed enormous back then)

Wife 58 yrs old earning 92K  - retirement is still several years off  & maxing out 403b as well.

My 403b is currently 260K & I am maxing it out & at current projections will top 400K in several years with roughly the same math for my wife's.

So, now to the meat of the matter, If I continue to work till my wife can retire in 4-6 years, I'll still be @ my RMD in under 2 years & all it will do is increase our taxable income. I know, worse problems to have but with no deductions & always taking the short form, I REALLY will hate increasing my Fed tax contribution.

1. We are overexposed to my company stock (volatile stock) held in taxable account - 20% of our $6M. Given our MAGI and that I’m retiring, I am seeking advice on what’s the best strategy to reduce exposure and save on taxes. I’ve held majority of that company stock for over a year.
2. CFP recommends a 65-35 portfolio so the gains from selling company stock would move into bonds. Have never invested in bonds and need to learn about them but what are your thoughts about buying bonds in this market?

Let us know what additional information you need. Thanks in advance for your replies.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ldkptn/reducing_overexposure_in_retirement_portfolio/,Analog Devices
2025-06-17 10:49:43,Eutelsat’s newly appointed CEO firmly denied that the satellite operator was in financial difficulties.,"Eutelsat’s newly appointed CEO, Jean-François Fallacher, speaking at the Paris Air Show, firmly denied that the satellite operator was in financial difficulties.

“Let me correct a misimpression: Eutelsat does not have financial difficulties: No. Eutelsat has a need for financing. There’s a difference,” Fallacher asserted. “We need financing to develop the constellation and continue our growth, which has already started and has been significant, and to conserve this unique strategic capacity.”


“We at Eutelsat provide our OneWeb network in low Earth orbit that is sovereign and European. There is a real appetite for this sovereignty across the industry,” he added.

Indeed, Fallacher emphasised that Eutelsat’s OneWeb mega-constellation is benefitting by being a valid alternate to Elon Musk’s Starlink, noting: “In the world now there are only two broadband [LEO] constellations in service: Starlink and OneWeb. What has happened in Ukraine and the recent statements of Musk, threatening a to stop work on a NASA contract, is an opportunity for us. Here we see what it means that an actor as key as that can threaten to stop service.”

Nevertheless, the need for extra financing is considerable. While there are numerous reports that Eutelsat is looking for around €1.5 billion, this might not be sufficient. It is generally accepted that replenishing the OneWeb fleet of 650 craft will cost much more that €1.5 billion. Then there’s Eutelsat’s commitment to the EU’s IRIS2 constellation which will need an additional €2 billion or so. Additionally, Eutelsat is carrying around €2.7 billion of debt.

2025-06-16 22:32:35,Why US Stocks Aren’t Bracing for a Bigger Sell-off Despite Israel-Iran Tensions?,"Key reasons for today’s resilience:

* A study by Deutsche Bank shows that markets typically fall about 6% in the three weeks following a geopolitical shock, only to regain ground in the following three weeks. Historical precedent suggests that unless a conflict leads to a significant slowdown in economic growth or a spike in inflation - think oil embargoes in the 1970s or the Kuwait invasion in 1990 - it rarely leaves a lasting impact
* **Modest risk aversion:** High-yield credit spreads widened just 2 bps a sign of only mild caution.
* **Low positioning:** With equity exposure historically light, there’s less forced selling into weakness.
* **Oil’s muted response:** Brent crude hasn’t yet surged to levels that threaten growth or Fed rate-cut expectations
* Do you agree that markets are underestimating the risk until we see clear growth or inflation impacts?
* Are you adjusting your portfolio for geopolitical risk - e.g., cutting back on cyclical investments or adding defensive investments - or are you sticking to the core thesis?
* Have you traded around any recent spikes in VIX or oil as a hedge against a sudden escalation?

2025-06-16 21:43:50,US and UK say they’ve cemented a trade agreement that Trump calls fair for both nations,"No paywall: [https://apnews.com/article/trump-starmer-trade-deal-beef-g7-52bea5eb383a0b45d0d83e1982d277bf](https://apnews.com/article/trump-starmer-trade-deal-beef-g7-52bea5eb383a0b45d0d83e1982d277bf)

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they’d struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

Starmer said Monday that the trade agreement is “in the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.”

Trump said the deal is “gonna produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.”",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ld5o6k/us_and_uk_say_theyve_cemented_a_trade_agreement/,Texas Instruments

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares popped nearly 10% to lead S&P 500 gainers Monday as Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target for the stock coming out of the chipmaker's ""Advancing AI"" event. 

Piper raised its target to $140 from $125 and maintained an ""overweight"" rating for AMD stock. Shares of AMD were at about $127 in recent trading, making Piper's target a roughly 10% premium. 

The analysts came away ""enthused"" by the firm's newly unveiled Helios server rack architecture, which it called ""pivotal"" for the growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Helios will combine next-generation AMD MI400 chips into one larger system, the company said, and is expected in 2026. 

AMD highlighted its partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Meta Platforms (META), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others at the event. Bank of America analysts believe there’s another high-profile partner announcement to come: Amazon (AMZN).

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was ""a key sponsor for the event,"" BofA said. However, AWS typically uses its own events to announce new engagements, making a future reveal likely, the bank added.

BofA maintained a ""buy"" rating and price target of $130 following the event. For comparison, the analyst consensus price target from Visible Alpha is about $124.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ld4a39/amd_soars_10_as_piper_sandler_raises_price_target/,Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
2025-06-16 20:14:21,When will fundamentals matter again?,"You’ve all heard the anecdotes: when your taxi driver talks about stocks and trading, it’s time to sell. The problem is that the taxi drivers have been talking about stocks and trading since 2020, and retail investors are obsessed. Anecdotally, I see chatter about stocks, trading, FIRE, and DCA everywhere.

There doesn’t seem to be any problem with investing in junk. Fartcoin is the ultimate example.These investors, mostly young guys, must think investing is the easiest thing ever, since by staying long term they haven’t lost a dime for taking on risk.

Unfortunately, rational value investors have had their worst underperformance ever seen in the data.
