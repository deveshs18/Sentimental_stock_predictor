2025-06-18 22:45:21,Gene-Editing Stocks Gain on LLY-VERV Deal Announcement,"Eli Lilly’s recent announcement to acquire Verve Therapeutics, Inc, a Boston-based clinical-stage company developing genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease, has put the spotlight on other promising companies developing gene therapies.

Post this acquisition, Lilly will add Verve’s pipeline of gene therapies targeting heart diseases. This includes VERVE-102, an investigational in vivo gene-editing therapy aimed at reducing cholesterol levels.

The share price of other gene-editing companies like Crispr Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics rallied following the announcement. Other companies in this space like Beam Therapeutics were also up. However, share price of Editas Medicine pared most of the gains recorded during the day and ended the session in red.

A Look at Promising Gene-Editing Companies

The rapid evolution of genomics, the study of genes and their functions in recent times has paved the way for a revolutionary era in genetic medicine.

Gene-editing companies hold potential to treat and cure diseases caused by genetic variants. As the name suggests, they make changes or correct defects in the organism's DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a breakthrough in the development of genome editing approaches.

Shares of NTLA were up 6.9% on June 17 on investor optimism about its prospects. Intellia Therapeutics is a clinical-stage gene editing company, focused on developing drugs with CRISPR-based therapies. NTLA is leveraging its modular platform to advance in vivo and ex vivo therapies for diseases with high unmet need.

NTLA’s leads in vivo product candidates are nex-z for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and NTLA-2002 for the treatment of hereditary angioedema.

CRISPR Therapeutics is rapidly leveraging its CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform to develop therapies for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies, cancer, diabetes and other diseases. Shares of CRSP were up 3.9% on June 17. CRISPR Therapeutics achieved a milestone in November 2023, when it received the first-ever authorization/approval for a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy under the trade name Casgevy. CRSP has collaborated with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals for Casgevy.

Meanwhile, BEAM is advancing a broad, diversified portfolio of base editing programs against distinct, genetically validated editing targets.  The company is currently developing BEAM-101 for sickle cell disease (SCD). The FDA recently granted orphan drug designation to BEAM-101 for SCD.

Editas Medicine is a clinical-stage genome editing biotech developing treatment using its proprietary genome editing platform based on the unique CRISPR technology. The company is currently focusing on in vivo (within the living organism) pipeline development.

Focus on M&A in 2025

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) have picked up significant pace in 2025 in the pharma/biotech sector after a passive run in 2024. The recent spree of acquisitions signifies a focus on portfolio expansion and constant pipeline innovation amid the recent tariff threat.

While oncology and immuno-oncology companies have always been at the top of acquisition targets, the lucrative obesity sector and gene-editing space are also being eyed.

Pharma giant Sanofi recently announced that it will acquire Blueprint Medicines for a total deal value of up to $9.5 billion to expand its portfolio in rare immunological disease and add an early-stage pipeline in immunology. The impending acquisition will add Blueprint Medicines’ only marketed product, Ayvakit (avapritinib), an inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA proteins, to Sanofi’s commercial portfolio.

In April, pharma giant Johnson & Johnson acquired Intra-Cellular Therapies for approximately $14.6 billion and added antidepressant drug, Caplyta, to its neuroscience portfolio.

Swiss pharma bigwig Novartis, too, has been on an acquisition spree.  Novartis is all set to acquire San Diego-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Regulus Therapeutics to strengthen its renal disease portfolio.

As M&A momentum accelerates across the gene-editing and biotech landscape, stocks like CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, BGM, EXEL, and ARWR may stand to benefit from renewed investor interest and potential strategic partnerships.

M&A activity is expected to accelerate further in 2025, given the massive cash reserve owned by major pharma and biotech companies and intensifying pressure from investors to diversify business.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1leuykb/geneediting_stocks_gain_on_llyverv_deal/,Analog Devices

2025-06-18 20:59:52,Texas Instruments Unleashes $60 Billion Chip Investment Surge,"Texas Instruments *(TXN)* just announced a $60B commitment to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, the largest in its history.

* *""Texas Instruments plans to invest over $60 billion in US to make foundational chips""*  \- Reuters, Bloomberg. 
* Unusual News Volume Factor: 6x its normal. 
* **Stock Reaction: +0.33% today | -0.71% over 5D.** 

News Highlights:  
Texas Instruments (TXN) has announced a sweeping $60 billion commitment to expand its domestic semiconductor operations marking what it calls the largest investment in foundational chip manufacturing in U.S. history.

The investment will fund the construction or expansion of seven chip fabrication plants across three sites in Texas and Utah, including two new facilities in Sherman, TX. The company estimates the initiative will create up to 60,000 jobs across the supply chain and construction ecosystem.

Back in August 2024, TI had outlined a roadmap to build out seven fabs, with projected spending of $40 billion in Sherman and an additional $21 billion across its Utah and other Texas sites. This week's announcement formalizes that vision while slightly increasing the total budget.

The company is aggressively ramping up in-house manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on overseas supply chains and counter the rise of Chinese analog chip competitors. The effort aligns with broader U.S. policy initiatives to reshore critical technology production.

While no detailed timeline was disclosed, Texas Instruments noted that the capital will be allocated over multiple years, with approximately $46 billion earmarked for Texas and $15 billion for Utah. TI emphasized that its long-term capital expenditure plan remains consistent, underscoring a strategic rather than reactive expansion.

2025-06-18 20:34:05,MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity,"According to the Financial Times Microsoft may terminate ongoing talks to deepen its partnership with OpenAI citing unresolved disputes over governance and future equity structure

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Is MSFT losing strategic leverage here? Or are they just protecting their current ROI？Could this open the door for Google, Amazon, or even Meta to get in bed with OpenAI?How would a fractured OpenAI impact Azure’s AI moat vs AWS and GCP?MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity

4) European Defence: Bought EUAD when Trump was dissing NATO, figured they would get spooked on relying on the US and accelerate inhouse manufacturing. Still riding but not adding more.

They have low % change because I just bought back after selling it all on Monday after big gains.

DD

Firstly, people love to hate on OKLO and call it overpriced, when it will easily be $100+ when they start producing based on all the contracts they signed and the energy they will sell, which is absolutely genius to do. Their tech isn’t just making SMRs because they aren’t the only ones, the smart part is selling the energy itself making it an even safer process. Speaking of safety,

Nuclear is the second safest energy production method after only hydro, by death rate.

Its also insanely cheap after it starts producing, and much more reliable than ones that take less like wind or solar.

It’s also very clean, even when compared to so called clean options like solar, which arguably cause even greater damage to the environment because of all the cobalt and other minerals that they require to build batteries and other parts, extracted from the horrible mines in Congo. 

People might be thinking it’s too late, after the boom which came since liberation day. But it’s really far from over. Uranium prices are only at 75, and they’ve been higher than 100 a few years ago. 

It doesn’t matter if you chose a start up like OKLO, or if you chose an established company like Cameco. OKLO and cameco are at their ATH, and cameco has been publicly traded for nearly 30 years already, still growing.

Also, June is normally a slow month in this sector and it’s doing great, just wait for the better months!

2025-06-18 16:26:06,"Waymo cars are coming to New York, but with a driver behind the wheel","Residents of New York City will soon start seeing Waymo cars cruising the avenues. But at least for now, a human will be in the driver’s seat.

Alphabet’s self-driving car unit announced on Wednesday that it plans to drive vehicles manually in New York, marking the first step toward potentially cracking the largest U.S. city. Waymo said it applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel in Manhattan.

“While we won’t be in New York full-time yet, we have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future,” the company said in an announcement. “We’re working towards that goal in a few key ways.”

If the permit is granted, it would be the city’s first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles. New York state law currently prohibits a service like Waymo to operate without a driver.

“We’re advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel,” the company said.

Meanwhile, Waymo is aggressively expanding into new U.S. markets. Waymo One, its ride-hailing service, provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas, and is preparing to bring fully autonomous rides to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., in 2026.

Waymo has made a prior appearance in New York.

The company brought its cars to parts of the city in 2021 for manual driving, data collection and testing. Ethan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, said “it was a planned trip with a start and an end.” The testing allowed Waymo to improve driving in icy and snowy conditions in a densely populated area, the company said.

2025-06-18 16:13:04,Is it a good idea to put $100K in SCHD in my taxable brokerage account,"For context, I’ve already maxed out my Roth IRA for the year (which I do every year) and I contribute regularly to my 401k through work. I currently have about $100K sitting in a HYSA and I’m thinking about moving it into SCHD in my taxable brokerage account.

My goal is to collect dividends every quarter and reinvest them. Eventually, I’d love to use the passive income to help pay for things like rent or even the occasional vacation.

The issue is everyone keeps telling me it’s a bad idea because of taxes and that I shouldn’t focus so much on dividends. But I’m not sure what a better move would be. I don’t want to leave that much cash just sitting in a HYSA long-term and the Roth IRA contribution limit is around 6 thousand I believe.

If you were in my shoes, where would you park this money? Would SCHD really be such a bad idea?

2025-06-18 15:54:43,"Why large conflicts, economic changes are not impacting stock markets in last 2 months?","There is something called risk fatigue that has gone into the minds of investors in recent weeks who have become tolerant to large economic shocks (war, fed rates, politics, tariffs etc. ) and are still putting in liquidity that is available. This is also a record stock buyback period which has kept tech stocks stable. AI stocks are a no brainer for many and the second factor to keep tech stocks up and stable. 

The dollar degradation has also caused the USD value of a US traded stock remain stable as USD itself degrades in value. 

The P/E ratios for the broad market are stretched, and yet capital keeps flowing in due to FOMO. It's like standing on what feels like solid ground, but in reality, the sea floor is dropping and no one knows how far down it goes. 

Caution is needed, because the crash may not happen tomorrow, but there is a huge disconnect from fundamentals in this market. The reason bubbles burst and don't just deflate is because reality hits hard.

2025-06-18 14:56:00,How do you factor a stock's “end life” into your long-term holdings?,"(Sorry if this is a naive question.) FYI I’m investing for long-term / retirement. I own some tech stocks that have done very well, but it’s got me thinking: “will these companies still be relevant / valuable when I retire in 20-30 years?"" For example, look at Intel: they were King a decade+ ago, and now they’re down 65% since 5 years ago. Were people short-sighted to include Intel in their retirement portfolio?

More generally, I’ve been thinking-- Even if a business / stock has a great 5-10 year outlook, it might become obsolete in 20-30 years. Of course, you could sell the stock when the outlook turns negative, but then you're paying CG taxes (i.e., it's no longer a long-term / retirement investment). 

So my question is: How do you take into consideration the loooong-term / ""end-life” of a stock when investing for retirement? Do you only include stocks that seem “timeless” in your retirement portfolio? Or do you just diversify enough to hedge against a few stocks losing the bulk of their value at some point in the long-term? Or do you just assume that you’ll sell a stock before the downturn, eat the CG tax, and move it into another stock with a solid 5-10 year outlook?

2025-06-18 14:30:37,LULU might be one of the best long-term plays no one’s talking about right now,"Ive kept an eye on LULU for a while, and honestly the recent pullback looks odd to me if were talking long horizons.

First off, the fundamentals are rock solid. This isnt one of those flashy growth stories that eats cash at every turn. Lululemon posts steady revenue gains, gross margin still sits above 55, and the bottom line is healthy. Their balance sheet reads like a textbook-very little debt and strong cash flow. You rarely find that mix in retail.

The brand story is even better. Lululemon isnt just pushing leggings; theyre selling a lifestyle. Loyalty is off the charts. They hardly ever discount, yet shoppers keep returning. Unlike Nike or Adidas, nobody seems tired of the logo. Among younger crowds LULU is still gaining cool points, not losing them.

What most folks overlook, though, is the overseas prize, especially India.

They just unveiled a major entry plan for that market. Anyone tracking Indias middle class knows how big this can be. Rising incomes plus a booming fitness ethos are perfect soil for Lululemons seeds. The premium athleisure space there is still mostly wide open.

I think I was just trying to root for the underdog and hope that AMD would catch up to Nvidia and then their stock would skyrocket. But it's pretty clear now that that isn't going to happen. Would it be a good idea to sell half of my AMD shares and reinvest the proceeds into Nvidia stock to diversify? That way, if Nvidia continues to pop off, I will be able to enjoy some profit from that instead of continuously feeling disappointed that AMD is underperforming.

2025-06-18 12:39:41,"Fed announces meeting to discuss easing capital rule, boosting banks' monetary power.","**Loosening of the supplementary leverage ratio would significantly increase the monetary power of banks.**

* US regulators are considering changes to a key capital rule for major banks
* The U.S. central bank announced the board meeting, scheduled for June 25, to discuss changes to the so-called ""supplementary leverage ratio,"" which requires banks to set aside capital against assets regardless of their risk.e Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are reviewing adjustments to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio that applies to the largest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.
* Under the proposal, the capital requirement for bank holding companies could be reduced to a range of 3.5% to 4.5%, down from the current 5%. The banks' operating subsidiaries would likely see their requirements fall to the same range, compared to the existing 6%.
* Banks say the current requirements are excessive and poorly calibrated, and some of that cash could better serve the economy by being lent out.
* They point to how big banks weathered the COVID-19 pandemic and their role in stabilizing regional banks during turmoil in 2023 as proof that they are resilient and do not need to tolerate more onerous rules.
* Among the industry's goals are to lock in a much weaker version of the ""Basel Endgame"" capital rule[,](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-is-basel-iii-endgame-why-are-banks-worked-up-about-it-2023-07-24/) reduce a capital surcharge levied on global banks, re-work a key leverage constraint, and overhaul the Federal Reserve's annual ""stress tests"" which assess whether a bank could withstand an economic shock, said three executives with knowledge of the ambitious lobbying plan.
* If adopted, the changes would represent a significant loosening of post-2008 financial crisis rules designed to ensure banks can absorb losses and remain solvent during periods of market stress. ",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1leg1ix/fed_announces_meeting_to_discuss_easing_capital/,Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

In the last month, the stock price has oscillated between $196 and $202 since the end of May, and is still below the key 50-day SMA of $205.69 and the 200-day SMA of $225.74, indicating that medium- to long-term downward pressure still exists.From a fundamental standpoint, Apple achieved revenue of $95.4 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up 5% year-over-year Diluted earnings per share of $1.65, up 8% year-over-year, both of which exceeded Wall Street's expectations

2025-06-17 19:07:40,"Meta to release smart glasses with Oakley and Prada, extending Luxottica partnership","Meta and EssilorLuxottica plan to release versions of their AI-powered smart glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands, CNBC has learned.

The addition of Prada and Oakley underscore the breakout success Meta had with its second-generation Ray-Ban glasses released in partnership with Luxottica in 2023. The Oakley expansion will be done in partnership with Luxottica, while the addition of Prada signifies Meta’s first step toward bring its wearable hardware to more fashion companies. 

Meta on Monday teased the Oakley release on social media, launching an Instagram account for “Oakley | Meta” with a profile description that reads “The next evolution is coming on June 20.”

CNBC reviewed a document that says the new glasses with Luxottica will be aimed at athletes. Meta is targeting active consumers after seeing several owners of its Ray-Ban glasses use the device to record themselves playing tennis, skiing and doing other activities.

The Oakley version of the glasses may cost around $360 as they are more weather resistant than their Ray-Ban counterparts, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the upcoming device. The first version of the Oakley Meta glasses will feature similar technology to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses released in 2023.

Luxottica, based in France and Italy, has licensing arrangements with over 150 brands and owns notable brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.

Meta’s agreement with Prada comes after the fashion company in December renewed an eyewear-related licensing agreement with Luxottica for 10 years. That deals covers the “development, production and worldwide distribution of eyewear under the Prada, Prada Linea Rossa and Miu Miu brands,” the companies said at the time.

Besides giving Meta a high-end partnership, the Prada glasses may be a particularly good fit for the tech company as many of the brand’s models come with thick temples, former Meta employees said. That provides more heft for housing many of the components necessary for smart glasses, including microphones and chips.

It’s unclear when the Prada deal and product line will be announced.

Meta first partnered with EssilorLuxottica in 2019 to jointly develop the Ray-Ban glasses. The two companies released the first version in 2021, but they found success after the release of the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses in 2023. That version comes equipped with the Meta AI voice assistant and includes features and, when tethered to a smartphone, lets users identify city landmarks, get recipes when looking at ingredients and record and send voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger.

EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February the companies have sold 2 million pairs of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses since 2023. Miller said he aimed to increase annual production to 10 million units by the end of 2026.

Meta and Luxottica announced an extension of their partnership in October, with plans to release more versions of their Ray-Ban glasses. That deal was worth $5 billion, according to a July 2024 report in The Wall Street Journal. As part of the deal, Meta gets exclusive rights to Luxottica’s brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. 

The two companies plan to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC has previously reported.

Competition in the market is heating up.

Last month, Alphabet announced a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker that will see the two companies team up to release glasses infused with Google’s Gemini AI assistant. The companies plan to release the glasses sometime after 2025. 

Snap, meanwhile, announced in June that it plans to release its sixth generation smart glasses under a new brand called Specs. Those glasses, expected for release in 2026, will include augmented-reality technology and will be smaller and lighter than Snap’s prior products, Snap said. 

Meta declined to comment. Luxottica and Prada could not be reached.

Bloomberg News first reported about the Oakley Meta glasses in January.

2025-06-17 16:33:35,Sell rental property or keep it?,"Hi All,
I’m in a financial dilemma and was wondering if there is a different perspective I might be missing here.

I have a rental property that I’m thinking about selling but I have positive rental income on it currently. 

Here are my financials:

Single, no kids
(Want to get married and have kids in the next 3-4yrs)
Income from job: 160K annually
Primary residence details: 
Mortgage: $672K
Value of primary home: $750K
Rate: 6.25%
Monthly payment: $4900

Primary home is in a developing area, potential for value increase, good school district. Most importantly, I absolutely love living here.


Rental property details:
Mortgage: $332K at 2.75%
Value of rental property: $640K
Monthly mortgage payment and expenses $2050
Monthly rent( after property management fees): $3000

Other financials:
Retirement savings: $190K
Taxable savings: $72K
HYSA: $17K
Debt: mortgages + Auto loan at 1.24% with a balance of $7.3K

I’ve also invested in real estate by building a retirement home for my parents where they live ( outside the US) and the equity on that is ~$450K

Now the dilemma:
Option 1
I’ve lived in the rental property as my primary residence until 2023 april ( at least 2yrs in the last 5yrs) so I won’t get taxed on capital gains upto $250K if I sold it before April 2026.
My renters are vacating in August 2025 so I was thinking I could sell it then. I would probably gain $270K that I’m thinking about paying down my current mortgage by $100K and investing the rest in HYSA and ETFs

Option 2 would be to keep renting and possibly incur additional expenses in the future. 
( may not be major expenses since I replaced my AC units and heater in the last 3yrs)
If the rates get lower on my primary home, I could refinance and pay off the loan with the excess funds or even refinance for 15yrs at a lower rate( but cash risky)


I bought my primary home in April 2024. I could move back into my rental property after a year and sell ny primary home but I’m not inclined to do that since I love living here. I bought this house based on certain future plans of starting a family but that didn’t work out and life had its own plans. But waking up to the sunlight and this beautiful home is kind of keeping me sane tbh. 

Any perspective appreciated.

So, followup question. As my RMD from my 403b will be here soon ( I'm 71) and we are both still working with a combined annual income of 211K  with no overhead other than a 20K mortgage which will be gone in 2 years if not paid off early, it's definitely not needed. Currently around 50K in savings.

Myself, earning 91K , social security 27K, small pension from 1970 job - $2,500 ( that seemed enormous back then)

Wife 58 yrs old earning 92K  - retirement is still several years off  & maxing out 403b as well.

My 403b is currently 260K & I am maxing it out & at current projections will top 400K in several years with roughly the same math for my wife's.

So, now to the meat of the matter, If I continue to work till my wife can retire in 4-6 years, I'll still be @ my RMD in under 2 years & all it will do is increase our taxable income. I know, worse problems to have but with no deductions & always taking the short form, I REALLY will hate increasing my Fed tax contribution.

Wife (48F) plans to work for the next 5 - 10 years because she wants to; not because she has to. We can both retire today (confirmed with a CFP) if we wanted to based on our assets and spending lifestyle.

We live in Virginia. Our net worth is $6M in equities (not including $2.5M in cash, crypto and house). Majority is in retirement accounts - 401K, IRAs and HSAs. House will be paid for in 4 years. Our 2024 MAGI was around $700K but after I retire next month, 2025 MAGI will drop to around $500K. And in 2026, will drop to $400K.

Questions:
1. We are overexposed to my company stock (volatile stock) held in taxable account - 20% of our $6M. Given our MAGI and that I’m retiring, I am seeking advice on what’s the best strategy to reduce exposure and save on taxes. I’ve held majority of that company stock for over a year.
2. CFP recommends a 65-35 portfolio so the gains from selling company stock would move into bonds. Have never invested in bonds and need to learn about them but what are your thoughts about buying bonds in this market?

“Let me correct a misimpression: Eutelsat does not have financial difficulties: No. Eutelsat has a need for financing. There’s a difference,” Fallacher asserted. “We need financing to develop the constellation and continue our growth, which has already started and has been significant, and to conserve this unique strategic capacity.”


“We at Eutelsat provide our OneWeb network in low Earth orbit that is sovereign and European. There is a real appetite for this sovereignty across the industry,” he added.

Indeed, Fallacher emphasised that Eutelsat’s OneWeb mega-constellation is benefitting by being a valid alternate to Elon Musk’s Starlink, noting: “In the world now there are only two broadband [LEO] constellations in service: Starlink and OneWeb. What has happened in Ukraine and the recent statements of Musk, threatening a to stop work on a NASA contract, is an opportunity for us. Here we see what it means that an actor as key as that can threaten to stop service.”

Nevertheless, the need for extra financing is considerable. While there are numerous reports that Eutelsat is looking for around €1.5 billion, this might not be sufficient. It is generally accepted that replenishing the OneWeb fleet of 650 craft will cost much more that €1.5 billion. Then there’s Eutelsat’s commitment to the EU’s IRIS2 constellation which will need an additional €2 billion or so. Additionally, Eutelsat is carrying around €2.7 billion of debt.

Currently, I contribute 10% of my income to 401k and net \~$40k. I have no debt, and I live in (and plan to stay in) a LCOL area. The only commitment I have with that \~40k is a goal of maxing-out my Roth IRA every year on the first day possible. For now, I am investing my Roth IRA entirely into FXAIX.

  


For my taxable brokerage, I am interested in a growth-oriented portfolio that is most likely to leave me in a good spot toward the end of that 6–8-year time frame.



I have been weighing some different options over the past year as to what this portfolio should consist of. Here are some ETFs I have considered:





\-VOO

  


\-VTI





\-QQQM





\-VXUS





I also plan to incorporate a small Bitcoin hedge, likely \~3%.

  


Currently, my account is allocated at roughly \~77% VOO, \~20% QQQM, \~3% Bitcoin. Not the most diversified and admittedly skewed by recency bias, but seemingly high potential for growth within my time horizon. I have been DCA'ing thus far and plan to continue.

  


I have played around with the idea of some different allocations, switching to VTI instead of VOO to further diversify, incorporating international exposure, and dropping or even further increasing my exposure to QQQM. All have very valid pros and cons. My lack of a strict deadline leaves me favoring potential for growth over diversification. I plan to slowly become more risk adverse as moving out becomes closer.

  


I am searching for guidance as to how others would approach this situation, knowing my goals and the investments I am interested in.

* A study by Deutsche Bank shows that markets typically fall about 6% in the three weeks following a geopolitical shock, only to regain ground in the following three weeks. Historical precedent suggests that unless a conflict leads to a significant slowdown in economic growth or a spike in inflation - think oil embargoes in the 1970s or the Kuwait invasion in 1990 - it rarely leaves a lasting impact
* **Modest risk aversion:** High-yield credit spreads widened just 2 bps a sign of only mild caution.
* **Low positioning:** With equity exposure historically light, there’s less forced selling into weakness.
* **Oil’s muted response:** Brent crude hasn’t yet surged to levels that threaten growth or Fed rate-cut expectations
* Do you agree that markets are underestimating the risk until we see clear growth or inflation impacts?
* Are you adjusting your portfolio for geopolitical risk - e.g., cutting back on cyclical investments or adding defensive investments - or are you sticking to the core thesis?
* Have you traded around any recent spikes in VIX or oil as a hedge against a sudden escalation?

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they’d struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

Starmer said Monday that the trade agreement is “in the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.”

Trump said the deal is “gonna produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.”",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ld5o6k/us_and_uk_say_theyve_cemented_a_trade_agreement/,Texas Instruments

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares popped nearly 10% to lead S&P 500 gainers Monday as Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target for the stock coming out of the chipmaker's ""Advancing AI"" event. 

Piper raised its target to $140 from $125 and maintained an ""overweight"" rating for AMD stock. Shares of AMD were at about $127 in recent trading, making Piper's target a roughly 10% premium. 

The analysts came away ""enthused"" by the firm's newly unveiled Helios server rack architecture, which it called ""pivotal"" for the growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Helios will combine next-generation AMD MI400 chips into one larger system, the company said, and is expected in 2026. 

AMD highlighted its partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Meta Platforms (META), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others at the event. Bank of America analysts believe there’s another high-profile partner announcement to come: Amazon (AMZN).

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was ""a key sponsor for the event,"" BofA said. However, AWS typically uses its own events to announce new engagements, making a future reveal likely, the bank added.

BofA maintained a ""buy"" rating and price target of $130 following the event. For comparison, the analyst consensus price target from Visible Alpha is about $124.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ld4a39/amd_soars_10_as_piper_sandler_raises_price_target/,ADP

2025-06-16 15:50:44,Are SMA fees ever not disclosed on clients' statements?,"My spouse and I met with a wealth manager at TIAA this month for the first time about our employer-sponsored retirement plans.  We also have non-retirement funds at Merril Lynch, and we had provided recent statements from them to the TIAA wealth manager so he could see our overall financial picture.

During that meeting the TIAA person said that Merril was charging us hidden SMA fees of over 2%.  He said these do not appear anywhere on any of our statements from Merill, but they were in fact being drawn out of our accounts, even during market downturns, and that they were in addition to the regular advisory fees which do appear on our statements.  He even calculated a specific percentage and specific dollar amount and said what Merril was doing was technically legal, even if it was unethical. 

Merril denies that this is the case, and frankly I believe them.  To imagine that we are being charged fees that literally appear nowhere is inconceivable to me.   But then that makes me ask why the TIAA person would even say this.  Would SMA fees generally not appear on someone's statement?  In other words, is such a situation even possible?   He said it was both possible and legal, and that he sees this all the time.  Is he right?

2025-06-16 14:12:04,Cathie Wood Just Bought Millions in Archer Aviation,"June 14 Ark Invest's Cathie Wood bought a large stake in Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR) after the stock slid nearly 15% Friday on a fresh equity sale.

According to recent news, Wood added about $40 million worth of ACHR shares across three of her exchange-traded funds. The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) led the move with over 2.8 million shares, while Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) and Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX) picked up smaller amounts.


The buying spree followed Archer's announcement of an $850 million direct stock offering priced at $10 per share. Investors reacted to the dilution risk, sending shares lower.

Archer, which builds electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, has laid out bold plans to launch air taxi services ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Separately, Wood's funds cut exposure to the defense sector, selling nearly $2 million worth of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ:KTOS) stock.

The recent executive order from former President Donald Trump, aimed at fast-tracking eVTOL integration, could create tailwinds for companies like Archer.

U.S. households to keep buying stocks this year, Goldman Sachs says

Jun 16, 2025

U.S. households are expected to remain major buyers of equities in 2025, according to a note from Goldman Sachs, which estimates they will purchase $425 billion in stocks this year, second only to corporates at $675 billion.

“The resilience of household demand for equities is vital,” the analysts said, noting that households “directly own 38% of the U.S. equity market and control an even larger share including indirect ownership through funds.” 

That demand is said to have persisted even as Goldman’s Sentiment Indicator “registers -1.2 this week, remaining in negative territory despite a 21% rally in the S&P 500 from its April trough.”

Retail trading activity also remains robust, according to the bank. 

“Goldman Sachs trading desk estimates of flows from retail trading activity suggests close to $20 billion of net buying during the past three months,” the note said.

Goldman attributes this sustained buying to a favourable macro backdrop. “The typical macro drivers of equity flows suggest households will keep buying this year,” with outflows generally linked to “weakening household balance sheets, rising unemployment, and increasing interest rates,” none of which are dominant now.

The bank added that the equity exposure of U.S. households has reached historic levels. 

“Households allocate 49% of their total financial assets to equities, the highest level on record,” slightly surpassing the previous peak in 2000. In contrast, households in Japan and the Euro Area allocate only 13% and 10%, respectively.

Retirement savings continue to play a key role. “We estimate contributions to 401(k) plans drive roughly $500 billion of annual equity demand,” Goldman said, noting the average equity allocation in those plans has increased from 66% in 2013 to 71% in 2022.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lcr2ph/us_households_to_keep_buying_stocks_this_year/,CSX Corporation

(Reuters) -Brussels negotiators hope that offering to accept U.S. tariffs of 10% across all of the European Union's exports into the United States will avert any higher duties on cars, drugs and electronics, newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Monday.

Citing high-ranking EU negotiators, the paper said the offer to U.S. counterparts would come only under certain conditions and would not be billed as permanent.

Handelsblatt also said the EU was, in return, ready to cut its tariffs on US-made vehicles, and to possibly change technical or legal hurdles to make it easier for US manufacturers to sell their cars in Europe.

The EU has also offered to completely ban purchases of Russian natural gas, potentially creating more demand for US producers.

The EU Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The EU's position comes partly from the realisation that President Donald Trump will rely on some tariff revenues to fund planned tax cuts.

US negotiators, however, have so far not agreed to limit their import duties on EU cars to 10%, the paper added.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lcqkym/eu_prepared_to_accept_flat_10_us_tariff_with/,Adobe Inc.

Trump announced he'll mail formal letters to dozens of trading partners (roughly 15 key countries like Japan, South Korea, EU, Canada, Mexico) within the next week or two, demanding acceptance of new tariff terms or else face punitive tariffs

The plan builds on a universal 10% baseline tariff and steep reciprocal tariffs for specific countries

Legal backing secured - temporarily - after an appeals court ruling allow these tariffs to stay in effect for at least two more months

The regime is shifting from broad multilateral deals to one-on-one negotiations, with the EU expected to be the toughest and last to be resolved

Futures are looking surprisingly strong today, despite high geopolitical tensions and the spark reality that tariffs will not be going away any time soon. 

Expect a lot of volatility over the coming days as key economic reports are coming out and tariff news is drip fed too.

VIX is one to watch as usual now.
