2025-06-23 19:29:58,CI holding up while rest of healthcare tanks  prior auth changes coming?,"UnitedHealth CVS Aetna Cigna Humana  all just pledged to streamline prior auth requirements after a meeting with HHS and RFK Jr

prior authorization has been a massive headache for providers and patients, blamed for delays in care and tons of admin bloat.

No real details on how this will happen but the optics are clear: regulators are applying pressure and insurers are trying to show good faith.

So far market reaction is muted UNH CVS HUM all flat to down.

But CI Cigna actually held up  +0.68% while the rest were red.

CI has been flying under the radar lately no meme hype no flashy headlines  just grinding higher.

If theyâ€™re seen as more compliant flexible than UNH CVS they could quietly benefit from policy tailwinds.

Not saying it a moonshot but looks like asymmetric upside vs sentiment.

Anyone else watching this space? Or still too much regulatory overhang?

2025-06-23 19:09:53,Google: undervalued tech gem?,"I recently started a large (for me) individual position in Google. While I remain bearish on the market as a whole right now, wise investors have said value can always be found in the market. A lot of the market feels very richly valued right now, especially large tech. AAPL, MSFT, NVDA and Meta all carry PE valuations close to 30 at the low end and closer to 50. Google however sits under 20.



Google is a major player in data centers, which I believe will be a huge space in the future. Google also has a strong AI program as well as a very healthy ad program. They continue to grow top and bottom lines and in March had a 38% profit margin on 90 Billion of revenue. 



Yet it seems the market isnâ€™t interested in Google. It is by far the worst performing Mag 7 this year, down about 13%. So with so many strong growth segments and a healthy valuation, where is the skepticism coming from?

They are an Advanced PCB Manufacturer & RF Supplier with a space and defense branch as well as commercial business . They supply parts to Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and more. They are in the midst of building another board shop in CNY which should be completed by early 2026, employing another 400 people on top of the current 16,000. They have plants in America and overseas. The stock was originally targeted around $ 35 and now is predicted to go into the mid 40's.  I believe this stock will continue to grow and has a stronghold within the industry. At this moment they hold a # 1 rating from Zacks Investment Research.

2025-06-23 14:29:48,401k Withdrawal for CC debt,"UPDATE:  Thanks to everyone for straightening me out.  I have decided to just stop putting deposits into my 401k and use the extra money each month to pay off the CC debt.  It will only take me a year and a half to resolve the CC debt and then I can really ramp up the deposits into my 401k.  Thanks so much everyone!!  

I want to clear up my remaining CC debt without having to pay several years on high interest.  I'd much rather take out from my 401k to clear it up and then I can invest more back into my 401k and I can catch up in 1 year and thus be able to continue to pump more into my 401k for the years to come.  I went to the online site and I don't see any options in the Hardship section that fits my category.  Do I select other and just type in what I plan to do with the money?  I'm unsure and I don't want to make any mistakes.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lii2l2/401k_withdrawal_for_cc_debt/,Paccar

2025-06-22 16:30:40,Predictable swing trade for NVDA?,"I'm very new to investing, like in December will be 2 years. 

What I've been mostly doing is buying NVDA at 100 and below, then selling at 130 and above in chunks. I have never sold at the top price, but I have bought at the very bottom couple of times. And it's been quite profitable 

I've recently talked to experienced investors and they scolded me for swing trading, saying that timing the market is not a way to go and I just should hold the position for decades.

 I'm not arguing with their approach, they know better. But if someone could explain why swing trading is bad and what you are doing with nvda right now I'd be very grateful.
