2025-07-01 17:55:30,Why the META narrative is underappreciated.,"This is my understanding of Zuckerberg's intent throughout Meta/Facebook's history.

1. Social Graph (2004-2011) - mapping real-world connections into digital form.
2. Data Extraction (2011-2018) - monetizing attention by modeling & manipulating behavior.
3. Platform Defense (2018-2022) - protect Meta's empire from regulators & competitive threats.
4. AI Bootstrapping (2022-2024) - training AI models using the world's richest behavioral dataset.
5. Interface Reinvention (2025-present)- building a new human-computer interface around persistent presence.
6. Sovereign AI (2025-present) - position Meta as a public-good default for everyday reasoning, commerce & relationships.

The last two appear to be parallel tracks that may eventually converge into Zuckerberg‚Äôs long-term vision: a persistent, AI-powered metaverse.

Zuckerberg is already moving aggressively - quietly assembling one of the strongest AI teams in the world, including talent responsible for key breakthroughs in open-source LLMs.

Most investors are still treating Meta like an ad business. Meta‚Äôs ad revenue is just the cashflow shell -  the real architecture being built is a sovereign operating system for human interaction.

Most won‚Äôt realize it until it‚Äôs already entrenched.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lp8itp/why_the_meta_narrative_is_underappreciated/,Meta Platforms

2025-07-01 07:59:21,Trump Takes Aim at Musk Over EV Subsidies; Tesla Shares Slump,"Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump lashed out at Elon Musk on Tuesday, accusing the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive officer of benefiting excessively from government electric vehicle subsidies. Tesla shares tumbled.

‚ÄúElon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,‚Äù Trump said in a Truth Social post. 

‚ÄúNo more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!,‚Äù he added.

This comes after Musk slammed the US Senate‚Äôs latest version of Trump‚Äôs multi-trillion dollar tax bill, warning that the cuts to EV and other clean energy credits would be ‚Äúincredibly destructive‚Äù to the country. Tesla shares slumped 5.8% in European premarket trading on Tradegate.

Tesla has benefitted from a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles that Trump‚Äôs bill will eliminate. The automaker is set to release second-quarter sales later this week that will likely show a further slump in demand.

‚ÄúElon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúIt is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one.‚Äù",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lovx48/trump_takes_aim_at_musk_over_ev_subsidies_tesla/,"Tesla, Inc."
2025-07-01 07:36:47,Google stock being pushed,"I've seen a recent uprise of google stock articles saying it's the best AI play right now, that the stock is not as valuable as it should be as an AI player. 

But this feels off, ChatGPT is practically threatening google search (The main revenue of their ads business).

They also fail to point out that google had chatGPT technology before OpenAI was created but they decided to focus on marketing (You know ads after ads ruining their service).

And now google query search is hitting lows never seen in decades:

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/)

Averaging between 2015-2022 87%.

After ChatGPT release in November 2022 It's down to 79%. And I think it's pretty correlated.

It's not difficult to realize most people are done with searching stuff on multiple websites. Even ChatGPT can handle boomers writing type (Google can't)

Google(and websites) ruined google search, prioritized ads, and the overall internet website stuff became supper annoying (pop-ups, cookies, ads, login, subscribe to read the full content).

  
Now, why I think they are pushing Google stock? I think they realized the company is going to get hammered hard in the next decades and it's easy to see that google can't execute for a long time, to try to salvage the situation. And they want to opt-out and find better AI plays.

**EV Demand Softness:** Broader market data points to cooling demand in key regions (e.g. Europe down 28% YoY in May)

**Production vs. Delivery:** Despite production increases, delivery shortfalls could pressure margins and pricing power this quarter

2025-06-30 19:24:45,How do you think progress in AI will impact investing and the economy?,"Currently in the middle of the FIRE journey, but a little anxious about the future of economics in general. AI is advancing at a rate that I think most people are not ready for. What happens to FIRE plans if 50% of people lose their jobs in the next 5-10 years? If the government has to provide universal basic income, what does having money even mean? 

Also, if the majority of jobs are replaced by ai, who will be buying the products and services that these companies provide? How will people be able to pay mortgages with no income? Will this entirely change the economy and what it means to use currency and/or wealth? 

I guess I'm just looking to hear what you guys think. I feel like I may make all of these sacrifices for decades only for my money to be worthless and the economy to be completely different by the time it comes to FIRE. 

And if you think I'm being dramatic, pretty much everyone working or forecasting in this field is predicting some version of this. Salesforce CEO said ai is already doing 30-50% of all jobs at his company. Lots of layoffs in software jobs, and it will only spread to other white collar jobs.

T The U.S. dollar has had its worst start to a year since 1973, weighed down by President Donald Trump's trade policy, a worsening outlook for the country's ever-growing public debt, and concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve.

The Financial Times reported that the U.S. Dollar Index had declined by 10 percent over the course of 2025, marking the weakest performance since the end of the Bretton Woods system, which was underpinned by the dollar's convertibility to gold.

Trump has staked much of his political reputation on his handling of the economy, pitching himself as the leader who can slash household bills, put more money in Americans' pockets through lower taxes, and lift commerce into a new golden age.

The dollar news coincides with the U.S. Senate gearing up to pass Trump's much-tweaked One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the tax-cutting provisions of which are set to expand the deficit by trillions of dollars over the coming decade, putting pressure on the dollar.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1logjlz/trump_oversees_worst_dollar_start_to_year_in_over/,Dollar Tree
