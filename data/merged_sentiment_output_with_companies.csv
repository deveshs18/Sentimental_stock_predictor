2025-08-05 03:39:40,Aurora Innovation - AUR - Current Leader in Autonomous Trucking,"https://aurora.tech/

Aurora Innovation (AUR) – Front Runner in Autonomous Trucking

Aurora Innovation is emerging as a leading player in autonomous trucking software and hardware, already conducting real-world testing on major U.S. freight routes.

⸻

Key Highlights • Cash on hand: $1.15–1.2B • Burn rate: $142M per quarter (~$600–700M annually) • Runway: ~6–7 quarters (18–22 months) at the current burn rate • Next steps to extend runway: Reduce burn, raise new funds, or both

⸻

Strategic Partnerships

Aurora has built strong alliances to accelerate autonomous trucking commercialization. Partnerships include: • Nvidia & Continental – hardware and software development for autonomous systems • Uber Freight, FedEx, Hirschbach, PACCAR, Ryder, Schneider, Volvo – logistics and trucking ecosystem collaborations

⸻

Founding Team • Chris Urmson – Former CTO of Google’s self-driving team (Waymo) • Sterling Anderson – Former head of Tesla Autopilot • Drew Bagnell – Former head of Uber’s autonomy and perception team

⸻

Current Testing • Test runs between Houston ↔ Dallas • Recently started El Paso ↔ Phoenix route (1,000 miles / 14 hours) • Advantage: This route exceeds the FMCSA Hours of Service limit (max 11 driving hours per day), giving autonomous trucks a major legal efficiency advantage.

⸻

Competitive Landscape • Waymo – No longer in trucking; focused on robo‑taxis • Other competitors are either speculative or private (not investable) • Likely no “winner-take-all” scenario; leadership could shift over 5–10 years

⸻

Investment Thesis • Market Cap: ~$11B (vs. Waymo at ~$45B) • No debt and $1B cash on hand • Analysts value AUR around $10/share

Upside Potential • 0.5–2 years: Possible 100% gain • By 2030: Potential 10x return if Aurora emerges as a dominant player

⸻

Personal Position • Holding 3,000 shares • $4,000 in Jan 2026 $10 calls $10–$15 2027 LEAPS",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mhyqom/aurora_innovation_aur_current_leader_in/,

Rocket Companies (RKT) just posted a strong Q2 earnings report, **even after finalizing the Redfin acquisition** this quarter. That is huge boost for the companies portfolio, most companies take a hit when they close a big deal like that, but RKT held up & had a solid earnings beat despite

Now here’s where it gets interesting:

* **The 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.2% & is looking to continue dropping**, down from 4.6% That’s a big deal for mortgage lenders. Here is the spark notes for you apes; Lower rates = more people buying homes = more business for RKT. = more $$$$
* RKT is also a seller of mortgages, they don't keep most of the loans they issue, they sell it to investors reducing the risk to RKT

[US 10yr losing it's 200 day moving avg](https://preview.redd.it/szw13hrsa4hf1.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=786e0c5a7f273df4310ec1e5866f031b78460145)



Now here’s where it gets interesting — **the short interest is no joke**:

* **81 million shares are short** (as of July 15)
* That’s **over 32% of the float**
* **Short ratio is 5.44**, meaning it would take over 5 full days of average volume to cover all those shorts

We’re already seeing movement. This is **Day 3 of the move**, and RKT is **up 14% over the last 3 trading days**.  RKT has broken a downward trend & with such large volume of shorts we can expect bear to continue to cover keeping upward pressure on the stock 

[RKT broke through 200 moving day \(blue\) with increasing volume](https://preview.redd.it/1ydi3m13e4hf1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=1521de26620755411b55785832b454d272eb47bc)

My first price target is **$18**, but if volume keeps climbing, **this will rip face to $24** in a hurry & leave some pretty sad bears.

Worth noting:

* The float is **tiny — just 17.76M shares available to trade**
* But the **implied shares outstanding is 2.1 billion** — massive difference
* Volume is ramping up fast: → **10-day average volume = 27.83M**, compared to the **3-month average of 16.2M**

So to sum it up for the Degen's with  only grade 2 reading   
✅ Strong earnings = profitable & real company with a real business ( not a meme stock)  
✅ Redfin deal is closed & they will benefit in Q3  
✅ Rates are dropping, completely invalidating the bear thesis  
✅ Bearish interest is sky high but we are seeing signs of covering  
✅ Low float + rising volume = Market is noticing and stock is getting  capital flow after being so beat up

I was wondering if the elites have lost all influence, I mean, there may be around 3000 people with networth of more than 500 million, they have the maximum to lose if things break down. IMO, they will try to make sure that the current economic/geopolitical system is not dismantled without an idea/plan about the future economic/geopolitical order. It can lead to chaos or hyperinflation or stagflation.

I heard on bloomberg this morning that senate is not going to let the destruction of Fed independence happen. This makes total sense to me since most of them have relationship with  industry leaders and they themselves have a lot to lose if we get economic crash like 2008. Supposedly, senate will make sure a qualified person will be the new Fed governor. I am guessing same applies to next Fed chair.

2025-08-04 21:31:05,"Opinion: The current market conditions in US equities is being driven primarily by retail, and it will end badly.","Disclaimer: This is an opinion piece, not financial advice. I may be wrong, and as ever do your own research.  
  
I think we can all agree that something doesn’t feel right about the current state of the US stock market.  
   
Valuations are stretched, fundamentals appear increasingly irrelevant, and AI hype is propping up a handful of tech giants that now dominate the S&P 500. There is talk again on Wall Street about a bubble, and for good reason. While institutional investors still drive most of the volume, retail investors have become a cultural force in this market, and that influence is rarely discussed with enough seriousness.  
   
The retail mantra of VOO and chill, buy the dip, market only go up etc, isn't just a meme anymore, it's a way of life for millions who are sleep walking into a situation they don't fully appreciate or understand. Social media influencers, YouTube finance channels, and TikTok traders have made passive investing and perpetual optimism trendy. With the widespread adoption of trading platforms that you can use on your phone at an instant, and zero-commission trading, newer investors are buying broad market ETFs and big tech names without always understanding the risks, or even the underlying businesses.  
   
Tesla and Palantir are good examples . These stocks trade more on narrative than on cash flow or earnings. The enthusiasm is rooted in future potential, especially around AI, not today's performance. And in many cases, these companies are simply selling AI tools to each other or hoarding compute capacity, rather than delivering real consumer-facing monetization. There’s a circular logic at play, in that tech firms are bidding up each other’s valuations with massive cash piles, creating the illusion of demand and progress.  
   
Meanwhile, under the surface, the macro picture is getting gloomier. Recession indicators are flashing amber, slowing growth, falling real wages, weak consumer confidence. Layoffs are rising, particularly in white-collar and tech sectors, and corporate earnings are showing signs of strain. Add to that geopolitical tensions, unpredictable trade policies, and potential tariffs that could shock supply chains. AI, the very force driving the market, is going to accelerate job losses. If you disagree with this you are blind.  
   
Then there’s Trump, who seems intent of crashing the world economy. Tariffs are almost impossible to defend if you are an advocate of global economic growth, and now he is applying massive pressure to the fed to cut interest rates. And with the latest jobs report, a rate cut might well be coming. A scenario where rates are cut too early, or money is printed again in the face of economic weakness, could easily reignite inflation, especially if tariffs are layered on top. That sets up the possibility of a stagflationary cycle not unlike the 1970s, slow growth, high prices, and little room for monetary maneuvering.  
  
So what happens next? I don’t claim to know for sure, but here’s what I think will happen:  
   
Inflation will spike after the fed is forced to cut rates and tariffs start to bite. Consumer spending dries up. The AI bubble starts to burst as people realise that there is no immediate and widespread monetization route to the masses. Big tech valuations, propped up by over enthusiasm and the greater fool theory, collapse. What follows is a grinding downturn... not necessarily a 2008-style collapse, but possibly a long period of stagnation and disillusionment, for as long as 10 years. I believe the start of the downturn will happen some time in the next 12 months.  
   
This isn’t a call to panic. It’s a call for realism. Passive investing is powerful, but it's not immune to cycles. The blind faith in “stock goes up” is exactly the kind of sentiment that tends to mark market tops, and has been seen many times throughout history.

Why does QQQI appear to be the better option due to market volatility and potential sideways action?,"I am trying to redo my portfolio in my roth after making some amazing gains with MSTR and COIN. I am trying to find a place to stick this money for the next 25-years (checking on it quarterly and reassessing) to maximize my returns.

Can anyone explain why QQQI would be a bad choice? I have reviewed the VXN since 2001 and it seems to stay high enough to keep QQQI providing decent yield (10%+) without eroding the NAV.

I am trying to hedge against sideways movement in the market since current prices seem too elevated and the economy in general seems to be slowing down.

Of course however as time showed, other competitors proved to be better, such as Apple with their innovative tech.

Ironically, commenters should have listened to the quote they were attempting to mock - be greedy when others are fearful. 

When the tariff fears were at their peak in April and market was down 16% YTD, I couldn’t believe the comments I was seeing all over reddit. This is just a small sampling of pure panic comments that had a lot of upvotes. 

Of course, hindsight is 20/20 and I wouldn’t be posting this if we never recovered. And I’m not saying we are out of the woods yet or shouldn’t expect another correction. However, something has to be said when the people who champion DCA and time in the market > timing the market completely crumble during a correction. 

Two takeaways:
- You must have high conviction in your investing strategy. I am a permanent, long term BULL and will always buy and hold. I will only get out of the market if I need emergency money or society as we know it is collapsing (in which case money would be useless anyway).
- The Reddit (and internet at large) hive mind is real. The sentiment on these subs could not have been lower in April yet here we are, doing alright in my opinion.

What do you guys think - anyone guilty of panicking and abandoning their strategy back in April?

My post history will outline many of the reasons why, but I think I've finally had to come to accept that this market will never see the likes of a massive, dot com, global financial crisis style correction ever again.

A global pandemic that shut the world down couldn't do it (SPY found a new high within 6 months).

Global conflict cannot do it -- the world is as to nuclear war as it's been since the collapse of the USSR.

Ridiculous valuations cannot do it -- The SPY is trading at a P/E that was only higher during dot com, GFC, and for one quarter after COVID hit -- at any point in the last 125+ years.

Bank failures cannot do it -- The failures of signature bank, silicon valley bank, and first republic banks, by assets under management, were larger than all the bank failures combined of the +/- 450 banks that failed in 08.

Rising delinquency rates in auto loans and credit card debt, paired with the highest balances on consumer debt in history have no effect.

A failing commercial real estate sector has no impact.

High interest rates, paired with an unaffordability crisis in the housing sector, means that a majority of Americans can no longer afford to buy a home... irrelevant.

Global trade wars that tank the market 20% only have the ability to hold that price action for 4 months before the market finds new highs.

No my friends -- I think the time has finally come for me to eat my words. To throw caution out the window. To say f\*ck the news, TA, historical precedence, or any individual smell test.

Sentiment across eVTOLs is clearly cooling off after the hype wave earlier this year & Archer’s still pre revenue, which means every move is amplified. No news from the company, just light volume & some options hedging

JPMorgan raised their price target from $9 to $10 but still kept a Neutral rating. They flagged cash burn and delays in revenue as key risks (nothing new) & called the recent market behavior *irrational exuberance.* Not wrong, but a PT bump is still a bullish tell

They also don’t expect Trump’s executive order *(which explicitly supports advanced air mobility)* to impact earnings soon but let’s be real, that kind of policy shift helps the long term narrative.

Technicals are a mixed bag right now. MACD shows a buy, but 20 day and 50 day EMAs are still above the current price, so short term traders are treating this like a downtrend. Doesn’t change my thesis.

The stock is still trading with speculative energy, but that’s how early-stage bets work. Analysts are still leaning bullish with a “Moderate Buy” consensus & a $11.92 PT *(almost 24% upside from here).*

For ACHR to rerate higher, they’ll need to deliver clean earnings, show progress on certification milestones, and eventually break into revenue territory. Until then, volatility is just part of the package.

2025-08-04 10:52:04,"$PTLO come for the earnings, stay for the value","**TLDR: $PTLO earnings Tuesday Aug 5th AM. $PTLO go up. Buy, make money.**

**My positions:**

***Shares a lot***

***options a little: Jan 2026 $15, Jan 2027 $12, August 15th $10s. Also sold some $10 CSPs in August, but that's probably a little advanced for this class***

$PTLO earnings releases on Tuesday, and I think it is set up to take off.  Ever been like *""Damn if only I bought $wing, $cava, $cmg early"".* Well guess what, HERE YOU GO.

What is Portillos? Chicagoland fast casual that serves, burgers, Chicago style hot dogs, polish sausage, italian beefs, chocolate cake shake, etc. IPO'd late 2021 and bagged a bunch of people (like literally every IPO of the time). Since IPO has been focusing on expansion outside of Chicagoland

# Bull Notes (in no particular order)

* Activist investor group Engaged Capital took \~10% position late last year and been working with $PTLO to quality candidates to the board and optimize expansion and restaurants. There most relevant and impressive work is with Shake Shack

* Jack Hartung was added to the board this year. He was CFO of Chipotle for 22 years and is current president. Has Chipotle fallen off in recent years, yes. But what we care about is he was apart of the EXPLOSIVE GROWTH of Chipotle since pre 2006 IPO. He is also on the board of $TSLA, which is cool, i guess (Portillo's Tesla diner anyone?) Pre chipotle he did 18 years for Mcdonalds Corp. Guy is solid
* Most recently, Eugene Lee was added to the board in June. CEO of Darden Restaurants from 2015-2022. Darden has some big name restaurants in their portfolio, so another star player to the leadership team that can guide Portillo's along the growth journey

https://preview.redd.it/yblypmfchzgf1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5f4aece1ba9ec6ffcbfbaddc5f9ecb4e4eedaf

* AUV (monies per restaurant) for Portillo's is crazy high $8.7 million per restaurant in 2025 (dragged down a bit by newer operations that aren't up to snuff yet). A chipotle does like 3 million, a texas road house does like 7 million. The only comparable I can find is Chik-fil-le which restaurants can do over $9 million. You should go buy there stock, o wait you cant.
* Total restaurants 94 at end off Q1. Restaurants were going loaded on the back half of the year. 1 Q2, 5-6 Q3, and 5-6 Q4. It'll be good to hear how that's progressing. My guess would be like 3-4ish by the time of the call. There goal is to get scale up to 12-15% per year and almost 10x restaurants to over 900 locations
* Breakfast. Experimenting with it, Already expanded locations from the initial 5 so thats promising. I've tried it, its delicious. Hope to hear some numbers. Mega bull example is McDonald's whose revenue from breakfast is like 25%. Maybe we could hope for a +10% revenue to start at full roll out (if its determined to make permanent and would likely only be chicagoland to start).  Would like to hear some numbers on the call
* PE current low 20s trading like its not a growth stock.

# Bear Notes

* Big sell off -10%  day, recently. Chipotle earnings caused a massive selloff in all restaurant stocks due to bad same store sales. I think its bullshit. Proof go look at $cake and $wing earnings last week. Turns its a chipotle problem not an industry problem. I guess sales go down when you charge more, give out less food, and treat customers like shit. This followed by general market tanking last week. This all to say its not PTLOs fault, its the market that's wrong!
* Daddy Powell cucking trump and won't cut rates. Yes generally small caps benefit from lower rates. They'd help PTLO thrive, but are not needed to survive and continue growing at a steady pace. Since jobs data got ""fixed"", maybe that changes sooner than later
* New restaurants performance. Growing pains IMO. Likely takes 1-2 years to reach maturity
* Poor stock performance. I call it opportunity.
* Cattle futures are to the moon. Think they've done pretty good keeping price up to offsets costs. Can they keep doing it?

Smart money been stock piling to sell later to u chasers. Front run it for once in your life. Big SEXY volume rising into earnings. You know what moves tickers VOLUME.

You know how I know this shit can go? Cuz I already round tripped some shares this year. Lows under $8 to just under $16 and back where we are today. It was lonely at the top. I want to bring friends with me this time.

2025-08-04 10:05:08,Since BLS Reports are about to lose relevance/credibility what other reports are you watching? ADP maybe?,"Let’s be real. If Trump wins and drops one of his people into the BLS, the jobs report is toast. Fully cooked. We’re talking “everything is fine” vibes while the economy bleeds out.

This isn’t tinfoil hat territory either. It’s already kind of happening. Look at May 2025: the BLS initially reported 139,000 jobs added. Two months later, that got revised down to 19,000. That’s not a small miss. That’s a total rewrite of the story.

Meanwhile, ADP reported 37,000 for that same month. Not perfect, but a hell of a lot closer than the BLS fantasy number. And that’s the point. ADP pulls data from actual payrolls at real companies. BLS does surveys and then layers on seasonal adjustments, revisions, and eventually, political spin.

Now imagine a loyalist takes over and starts reporting whatever number they’re told to print. Ten million jobs? Sure. Zero layoffs? Why not. Reality doesn’t matter when the data becomes a political weapon.

At this point, I’m not even watching the BLS numbers anymore. If the market still reacts to them, fine, but I’m treating them like CPI. Rigged until proven otherwise.

Here’s what I’m actually watching:
	•	ADP payroll data – based on real checks, not surveys
	•	Challenger job cuts – tells you when companies are getting nervous
	•	LinkedIn and Indeed job posting trends – real-time demand
	•	Conference Board employment index – solid composite signal
	•	Household Pulse Survey – faster, less manipulated than BLS

If we’re headed into a manipulated-data economy, I want to at least be looking at something closer to the truth. The BLS used to matter, but if the next admin turns it into a propaganda machine, it’s just another lagging indicator that lies.

2025-08-04 01:32:16,LUNR [DD] - Intuitive Machines Bull Case,"***General Background***:

Everyone who has read into this company knows that they had 'failed' IM-1 and IM-2 missions; however, in the eyes of people in the aerospace industry these are not true failures.

**IM-1** (Feb 22, 2024) was the **first U.S. soft landing since Apollo**; it touched down, tipped, but returned data.

**IM-2** (Mar 6, 2025) also reached the surface (**south-polar region, Mons Mouton**), but tipped inside a crater; it operated \~12–13 hours before power/thermal limits ended the mission, and still returned important data and tested novel systems (unlike competitors like Firefly).

Firefly’s Blue Ghost landed on the near side and ran >14 days, right before IM-2 'failed', which fueled even more negative sentiment toward LUNR. But IM-2 attempted a harder polar profile (low sun angles, deep shadows, rough terrain). Intuitive's next mission, IM-3, will target a near-side site, more like Firefly’s profile and *much more likely* to be successful.

IM leads the Moon RACER team with a $30M Phase-1 feasibility award (Apr 2024). NASA will pick one provider for a demo mission, then issue operations task orders under an IDIQ (ceiling up to $4.6B) through 2039. A Phase-2 win would create multi-year, recurring service revenue tied to Artemis surface ops.

LUNR also is working on an orbital transfer vehicle, a $9.8M Phase Two government contract through CDR positions IM for in-space mobility work beyond landers.

NASA selected Intuitive Machines for a potential 10-year, maximum of $4.82B IDIQ to provide lunar communications/navigation services core infrastructure for Artemis and commercial users. Early NSNS task orders are already funded; and relay-service revenue begins after the IM-3 satellite is accepted into operations.



***Catalysts:***

**Earnings (Aug 7th)**: Could announce new contract updates. Watch for information on their backlog.

**IM-3**: Reiner Gamma (near-side, well-lit, relatively benign terrain) carrying NASA’s Lunar Vertex suite and CADRE multi-rover tech demo. A successful 14-day surface campaign would materially de-risk Nova-C and validate service pricing. This is an easier mission and much more likely to be successful than IM-1 or IM-2. Will launch no earlier than Dec 2025. **IN ADDITION** \- IM-3 will release the first NSNS lunar data-relay satellite into lunar orbit, which will allow task orders from NASA to be filled, generating more revenue for Intuitive Machines.

**IM-4**: \~2027 Mons Mouton (again), lunar south pole... Carrying 2 more aforementioned satellites.

***Risks***:

**Execution**: IM-3 is somewhat of a breaking point after two tip overs.

**Contract Structure**: NSN/LTVS are IDIQ (Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity) ceilings, not guaranteed revenue.

**Competition**: Firefly, Astrobotic, Lockheed-led teams for Commercial Lunar Payload Services/Near Space Network/Lunar Terrain Vehicle.



***Quick Financials:***

Revenue: $62.5M (up 14% q/q).

Gross margin: 11% ($6.7M).

Operating loss: $10.1M.

Cash & equivalents: $373.3M at quarter-end (post warrant redemption).

Free cash flow: +$13.3M (operating cash $19.4M minus $6.1M capex).

Backlog: $272.3M (down from $328.3M Dec-24 due to work performed).

Outlook: FY25 revenue $250–$300M; run-rate positive adj. EBITDA by YE25, positive adj. EBITDA in 2026.



**My Position**:

[My LUNR Shares.](https://preview.redd.it/gmaqbjbmowgf1.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=049f6efc5bb94beff827c6d53503006847e607c9)

Had shares of LUNR since before IM-2, likely not selling until after IM-3.

*\*\*Repost; forgot to add my position the first time around.*



**TL;DR**: LUNR has meaningful contract runway (NSNS up to $4.82B, LTVS up to $4.6B, etc.) and cash. IM-2’s 'failure' didn't change that. In addition, if IM-3 sticks a clean near-side campaign and deploys the first NSNS relay satellite, it could result in a shift towards higher-margin services and could unlock more task orders.

I think we could easily see $20 per share again if IM-3 works out, and even higher with solid NSNS service orders and an LTVS Phase-2 win, thoughts?",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mh0i7h/lunr_dd_intuitive_machines_bull_case/,

2. 20% short interest - presumably because of financial reporting fears. SMCI went from 3 million shares short a quarter ago to 95 million shares short now (Fintel). I know finance and this is no longer a problem. SMCI clearly announced they Do Not Need to restate earnings and their auditors found no instances of fraud (given US laws, you don’t casually declare this on an earnings call). 
3. Meeting or even slightly beating earnings will squeeze the shorts’ balls blue. OPEN had a short interest of 20.73%, look what happened when it squeezed.
4. Massive expected INCREASE in AI spend. Ex: Recent Google earnings announced increase to $85 billion. X (Grok) working to launch millions of GPUs and shipping a “power plant” from Europe to power it. Every AI player (MSFT, META, AMZN, Open AI etc) will do the same increasing spend to the 70-90bill range. TSMC also reported great earnings. Clear sign demand is accelerating not slowing.
5. International expansion - SMCI won a Major Exclusive $20 billion DataVolt (Saudi Arabia) deal, Ericsson.
6. Raised 2.3 billion cash and sold 1.79 billion in receivables for expansion. Big-brain move at 0% interest with capped calls. They are currently generating cash and not burning it, which means the money is primarily for planned massive growth and expansion.
7. BofA Analist Ruplu Bhattacharya, has a $35 price target on SMCI, but had a price target of $1,090 at one point, which is a ridiculous joke. Big funds probably have major short positions and are now caught with their pants down and are using their Analist to beat prices down. They don’t know computers. If SMCI reports spectacular earnings on 8/5/2025, and their tits get squeezed, she’ll be relegated to OnlyFans.",reddit,https://i.redd.it/991cfpwwxvgf1.jpeg,
2025-08-03 22:52:05,27k to Invest for 2 - Need Advice,"Hi everybody 

I live with my gf and we're looking to begin investing properly. I've done some here and there but hardly know what I'm doing. 


We both want HYSA, an emrrgency fund, a Roth, and I'm open to advice about other kinds of accounts. 


Im 25, she's 26. I have about $10k to put towards this for now, she has about $18k. She would have her own accounts as I'd have my own. 


What would be the best ratio to spread our money across these accounts? Or maybe  there's a better, alternative route?

Thanks everyone 🎉


Edit: to add, I do already have my own brokerage account but have only invested maybe $200-$300 so far. I already have a Roth with also about $200-$300 in it. Both are with fidelity. My HYSA is with wealthfront

I make $65k a year, she's around $30k a year. For examples sake for now, I'll say I could invest $400 a month and she could do $300.

I searched google and had a long conversation with ChatGPT that went nowhere. I now understand P/E ratios when it comes to ""*A P/E of 670 means you pay $670 for every $1 the company earns annually""* because I heard a great vending machine analogy and I read a comparison about Microsoft.

(**Machine** **costs $2,000 up front. makes $200 a year; P/E = 10x**).

What I **don't** understand is the notion that it would take **ME,** the **STOCK INVESTOR**, that much time.

I feel blindsighted by the fact that the only money I will ever see is from when the value of the stock goes up.

The ""670 years"" thing to me makes no sense. Not that it makes no sense, as in I understand where it's coming from, but it's just untrue to me. It makes no sense **simply because I don't get it**, and can't find any resources that know what I mean when posing my question.

The root of my problem may be my ability to explain my confusion, but I tried to do my best to put it all together here, and the clarity seems perfect to me. Maybe the issue is everyone takes this phrase a face value and doesn't think about its meaning?... Idk.

The vending machine analogy was a great way for me to understand it when it comes to someone who actually gets the profit, but I'm completely failing to comprehend its connection to investing.

Fiscal and monetary policy have merged in practice, if not in name. The US is running structurally high deficits in peacetime, with no political appetite for austerity. Demographics are slowing, labor is tight, and the Fed is trapped between managing inflation optics and funding the Treasury.

If that’s directionally correct, then the real risk isn’t another 2008. It’s something closer to an inflationary recession - stagflation with political dysfunction. The kind of scenario where bonds don’t hedge, equities de-rate, and the market begins repricing money itself.

Traditional portfolios aren’t built for that. They’re priced for a continuation of the post-Volcker paradigm. They assume trust, continuity, and policy efficacy. All of which look increasingly fragile.

Digital assets sit awkwardly in this context - not as a clean hedge, but as a reflexive proxy for declining faith in fiat institutions. Not because they’re intrinsically valuable, but because they’re perceived as outside the system.

None of this is an argument for crypto exposure in itself.

We automate a healthy chunk of savings every month and I’m trying to decide whether to keep those dollars at Wealthfront or move them to a self-directed brokerage.

  
What I’m seeing

* **Wealthfront “Aggressive” Risk Score 10 Portfolio**
   * \~90 % global equities, 10 % alts (REITs, commodities)
   * 0.25 % advisory fee + fund expense ratios
   * Tax-loss harvesting + automatic rebalancing
* **DIY VOO (S&P 500) approach**
   * 0.03 % ER, zero advisory fee
   * Rebalance manually a couple times a year, no fancy TLH

**5-year total returns (to July 2025)**

* Wealthfront Aggressive: **\~60 %**
* S&P 500 / VOO: **\~103 %**



That’s a **40+ percentage-point gap**, and it has me questioning whether the extra diversification is actually paying off - or if I’m just paying for under-performance.  


# Questions for you all

1. **Anyone else on Wealthfront?** How do you stomach sticking with it when US-centric indexes keep pulling ahead?
2. **Global diversification**: Is the academic case (“don’t bet it all on one country”) still compelling in a world where the US dominates tech and profits?
3. **Tax-loss harvesting**: For those who left Wealthfront, did you miss automated TLH?

Here are the BLS Non-Farm Payrolls numbers for October, November, and December of 2007, based on the final revised figures:

October 2007: +103,000 jobs

November 2007: +124,000 jobs

December 2007: +18,000 jobs

Yes, the headline U3 unemployment rate hit a cycle high at 4.25% but in absolute terms that’s still a very low unemployment rate. However, we must take into account that Bureau of Labor Statistics Non-Farm payroll job numbers lead the U3 unemployment rate. 

Mainly because the U3 unemployment rate often stays lower for longer because even as layoffs increase, until unemployed individuals actually remain out of work long enough, they won’t affect the headline number.

Back then, Apple was a niche PC player, and the iPod + iTunes ecosystem made them a consumer titan. Atlassian’s in a similar spot strong with its interconnected suite (Jira, Confluence, Trello, Bitbucket) used by 83% of Fortune 500, but middle-tier against Microsoft, ServiceNow, and GitLab.


Rovo’s an AI platform baked into Atlassian’s tightly knit ecosystem, connecting Jira (dev), Confluence (docs), Trello (tasks), and Bitbucket (code) with third-party tools like Slack and Google Drive. Its unified search pulls contextual data across these tools, Rovo Chat answers queries with company-specific insights, and Rovo Agents automate tasks like backlog cleanup or code reviews. It’s powered by the Teamwork Graph (20+ years of workflow data) and free for Premium/Enterprise users.


Could Rovo’s integration with Atlassian’s vertical system where tools share data and workflows seamlessly be a game changer? It tackles pain points of work time spent searching. Rovo’s no-code agents let teams customize workflows, keeping them in Atlassian’s orbit, much like iTunes locked users into Apple’s ecosystem.


Microsoft’s Copilot and ServiceNow’s AI are tough competitors with bigger ecosystems. And B2B sales cycles are slower than the iPod’s consumer boom. Atlassian’s open integrations, unlike Apple’s walled garden, might limit lock-in. What do you think? Can Rovo make Atlassian the enterprise AI leader, or is it just another feature?

Despite the contours of a preliminary trade deal, German automakers Mercedes (MBG.DE) and Porsche (P911.DE) are still in a world of pain, suffering from the strain of Trump’s tariffs and shifting consumer preferences in markets like the US and China.

First up, Mercedes.

In the second quarter, the luxe carmaker reported revenue fell 10% to 33.15 billion euros ($38.82 billion), on adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of 1.273 billion euros ($1.47 billion) — a drop of 68% from a year ago. Net profit fell nearly 70% to 957 million euros ($1.1 billion) in the quarter.

“A dynamic market environment, volatile tariff policies, challenging competition, particularly in China, and upcoming model changes impacted sales development,” Mercedes said in a statement.

As a result, Mercedes cut its 2025 outlook with revenue expected to come in “significantly below prior year level” compared to “slightly below” previously. The auto business now sees its return on sales (or margin) dipping to a range of 4%-6% compared to 6%-8% seen previously.

On the analyst call, Mercedes CFO Harald Wilhelm said the tariff impact was in the “mid-triple-digit millions,” adding that the second-half effect would be higher, but still in that range per quarter.

Wilhelm said the tariff impact this year would hit margins by 150 basis points (1.5%), despite the new, lowered tariff rate of 15% in place, compared to the 27.5% levied before the preliminary trade deal.

The Porsche situation isn’t much better.

The Stuttgart-based automaker said revenue fell to 18.2 billion euros ($21.04 billion) in the first half of 2025, down 6.7% from a year ago, with EBIT dropping to 1.01 billion euros ($1.17 billion), a third of the 3.06 billion euros ($3.54 billion) reported last year. Porsche said “extraordinary expenses” hit its EBIT, including 400 million euros ($462.4 million) in tariff costs.

As a result, Porsche said its return on sales for the year would dip to a range of 5%-7% for the year, down from the 14.1% it enjoyed in 2024. Likewise, it said revenue would drop to a range of 37 billion-38 billion euros ($42.8 billion-$43.9 billion), down from 40.1 billion euros ($46.35 billion) last year.

“We continue to face significant challenges around the world,” said Porsche CEO Oliver Blume. “And this is not a storm that will pass.”

While the preliminary US-EU deal would see the tariff rate decrease to 15% going forward for the European imported goods, that’s still a significant cost for the German automakers. The prior tariff rate was only 2.5%, meaning customers will be paying for the increased costs.

Tariff headwinds also come along the backdrop of shifting consumer preferences in China, the world’s largest auto market. Chinese domestic consumers are increasingly shunning products from foreign automakers — once considered the highest quality and most desirable — to domestic producers like BYD and Xiaomi, which have captured the fancy of buyers with styling and features Chinese consumers prefer.

In the US, the Germans face another challenge. Slowing EV adoption has hurt Mercedes and Porsche, which had bet heavily on an EV transition that many saw as inevitable during the Biden presidency. Mercedes is no longer taking new orders for its EVs in the US. Porsche is working through high inventories of its Taycan EVs, which means discounting at the dealer level.

And now tariff costs on top of that.

In the US, Mercedes has price-protected its customers for all model year 2025 vehicles, meaning it has absorbed tariff costs — for now. Porsche announced price increases of 2.3% and 3.6% for its US models in July, on top of earlier price increases coming in the 2025 model year.

[CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)

Both Governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, sought a 25-basis-point reduction, as maintaining the status quo poses risks to the economy. Noted tariffs have only a temporary impact on inflation. These dissents are the first time two governors have done so since 1993.

Bowman (who also serves as the Fed’s vice chair for bank supervision) stated, “I see the risk that a delay in taking action could result in a deterioration in the labor market and a further slowing in economic growth.”

Their statements, as well as Powell's statement, came before the huge correction in the job data. The Labor Department report on Friday showed that nonfarm payrolls rose by just 73,000 in July, below expectations, while the June and May counts were revised lower by a combined 258,000, which showed virtually no growth for both months.

Some suggested that the Fed might have cut rates if the July jobs report had come before this past Wednesday's meeting. Powell's tone would also probably have been much more dovish if the job data corrections were known beforehand.

The probability of a September 25-basis-point Fed interest rate cut has jumped from 61.9% to 80.3% in 1 week.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mgh3ky/waller_and_bowman_say_waiting_to_cut_rates/,

2025-08-03 06:30:20,Looking for a better online trading app Chase isn’t cutting it,"I’m currently using the stock trading platform from my bank (Chase), and it’s been a real pain. The interface feels clunky and isn’t very intuitive. It also lacks support for after-hours trading and crypto, which isn't a major concern for me right now, but something I would like to get into. 

I’m looking for something better suited for more active trading, something with better tools, smoother execution, and ideally access to crypto as well. I was considering jumping over to Robinhood since it’s popular and looks cleaner, but I’ve heard mixed reviews about the experience, the customer service reliability, and customer support. Is it a step up from Chase, or just different problems?

I'd love to hear about the apps or platforms others are using, especially if you're doing frequent trades or dabbling in crypto alongside stocks.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mgcas3/looking_for_a_better_online_trading_app_chase/,

2025-08-03 00:42:42,Nasdaq100 rebalancing in Q3,"At the end of July, 5 of the Nasdaq 100 sticks fell below the 0.10% minimum to stay in the index.  Now the rule is that to be removed they have to be below 0.10% fur 2 consecutive month-ends, but I don’t see much way these bottom 5 improve in the next month.  The 5 stocks targeted for removal are:  Biogen, Global Foundries, CDW, Lululemon and Onsemi.  

In looking at upcoming candidates for inclusion, it looks like Equinix is the highest market cap company not included, however that was true at the year-end 2024 revaluing and still some lower market cap companies were included instead.  Does anyone know why this was?  

Also, given how top-heavy the Nasdaq 100 has gotten, is there a chance they change the 0.10% rule?  It feels like there will be a lot of removal/addition throughout the year amongst the bottom 5-10 Nasdaq 100 stocks going forward unless there’s a change in how they add/remove companies (outside the annual rebalancing of course).

About 44% of U.S. smartphone imports were assembled in India, while China’s share fell to roughly 25% and Vietnam’s was around 30%. 

The shift is driven mainly by Apple moving more iPhone assembly to India, with some contribution from Samsung and Motorola. 

Vendors also front-loaded shipments to the U.S. to hedge against possible tariffs later in 2025. 

Despite the supply-chain shift, total U.S. smartphone shipments grew only about 1% year over year; Apple’s shipments declined around 11% while Samsung’s rose about 38%. ",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mg3pw2/india_overtakes_china_as_the_worlds_largest/,
2025-08-02 22:35:06,Wash Sale Confusion,"Hi all, I'm seriously confused about the 30 days prior part, regarding the wash sale rule. I see a lot of stuff like this, when I google, or use AI: 

*Adhere strictly to the 30-day rule
Do not repurchase the same security or any ""substantially identical"" security within the 61-day wash sale window. This period includes 30 days before the sale, the day of the sale, and 30 days after the sale.
The safest approach is to avoid repurchasing the exact same stock or security within this window.*

but how the heck do you ""repurchase"" something in the past? The *30 days after* part makes perfect sense to me, just not the 30 days before part. From what I understand, it doesn't matter if I bought shares a year ago, or yesterday--it's still going to trigger a wash sale, if I sell those shares at a loss today, and buy back within the next 30 days...correct?

She has maybe 15k in a savings account earning like 0.5% interest and that's literally it. No 401k, no IRA, nothing. Should I help her set up a Roth IRA and maybe get her into some index funds? I'm worried she's going to have to work until she's 80 at this rate. Any suggestions would be awesome.

2025-08-02 06:55:44,Microsoft finally revealed Azures true revenue. What do we all think?,"Microsoft used to bundle all kinds of other devices like O365, server licenses, etc. into their “Intelligent Cloud” segment, muddying comparisons with AWS and GCP. Looks like this time, they finally caved and reported numbers. The growth always looked sus to me in the real world given everyone anecdotally swears by AWS and I know very few who use Azures compute or data infrastructures. 

Azure made $75B in the year, apparently growing 34% YoY. GCP is at $50B and AWS is at $111B. AWS has a sizable 32% lead over Microsoft here. 

AWS is also growing 18% and accelerating. But if we assume it stays at say 20% and Azure stays at 35%, it’s catching up by 15% a year. Applying simple compounding, this means Azure will take 3-4 years to reach parity with AWS around the $200B mark. 

Satya is super strategic. Why would he reveal Azure numbers now? Many analysts think it’s because Azure only recently showed that it has a shot of catching AWS due to OpenAI demand. Microsoft is paying openAI which is then paying Microsoft back for using azure compute. 

The future of cloud dominance is all going to come down to openAI carrying Azure growth vs the strength of their combined competitors like Anthropic, llama, Gemini, etc. Anthropic already has better models for some use cases. GPT is also not exclusive to Microsoft and already available on GCP. 

This is not even getting into profitability. We don’t know if Azure is profitable with the AI workloads. Microsoft hasn’t reported those numbers yet. But we do know AWS is printing money and has been even before AI. 

This is going to be an interesting 3 years. I think AI models are increasingly reaching parity. So if there’s no competitive advantage between them, I fully expect AWS to retain and even expand their lead as they simply offer a better product, prices, experience and support.

The payout includes $129 million in compensatory damages, and $200 million in punitive damages against Tesla. Attorneys for the plaintiffs had asked the jury to award damages of around $345 million. The trial in the Southern District of Florida started on July 14.

The suit centered around who shouldered the blame for the deadly crash in Key Largo, Florida. A Tesla owner named George McGee was driving his Model S electric sedan while using the company’s Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system.

While driving, McGee dropped his mobile phone that he was using and scrambled to pick it up. He said during the trial that he believed Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. His Model S accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, hitting a nearby empty parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle.

Naibel Benavides, who was 22, died on the scene from injuries sustained in the crash. Her body was discovered about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury and psychological effects.

2025-07-16 19:11:28,Annual PSA: Investing and Trading Scam Reminder,"For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - please be aware that social media platform like Reddit, Discord, etc. can be a vector for scams and fraud. 

Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. 

Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to pig-buthering scams and pump-and-dump scams. - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate.

1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot](https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/)
2. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else.
3. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks.
4. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
5. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

If you are in the US - you can always verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. You can check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/) You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

For those interested in understanding a little more about stock promoting and pump-and-dumps - one of the mods provided an AMA 15 years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with - you can find the AMA here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/158vi7/i\_used\_to\_be\_a\_penny\_stock\_promoter\_in\_the\_late/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/158vi7/i_used_to_be_a_penny_stock_promoter_in_the_late/)",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1m1llzv/annual_psa_investing_and_trading_scam_reminder/,
