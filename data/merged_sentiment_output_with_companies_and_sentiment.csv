This is still a company growing at more than 100% per year at 40x forward earnings. The Trump administration will continue to deregulate across the board, so I don’t believe their core business model is at risk for at least the next 3 years. Macro liquidity is going higher along with HIMS continuing to be a retail favorite. This is an opportunity to buy a market leader at a significant discount. Could it go lower? Absolutely, but in my mind the likelihood of this stock making significant new highs this year is quite good.

prior authorization has been a massive headache for providers and patients, blamed for delays in care and tons of admin bloat.

So far market reaction is muted UNH CVS HUM all flat to down.

But CI Cigna actually held up  +0.68% while the rest were red.

CI has been flying under the radar lately no meme hype no flashy headlines  just grinding higher.

If they’re seen as more compliant flexible than UNH CVS they could quietly benefit from policy tailwinds.

**Positions:** I am sitting on 90% cash and using my 10% for day trading - Recent profits were all on INTC and TSLA. I always close EOD. I bought FSENX for 5% of my funds

**Thought:** I like looking at indirect impact points in addition to traditional technicals. Example - I keep an eye on are on Fedex/UPS earnings calls for retail forecasts (shipping volume directly proportional to sales numbers), banking earnings for understanding liquidity, credit availability, and investment returns etc. and not wait for formal readings like CPI etc to post.

**Target:** I have a SPY target of 550 to 600 for July 2026.

**Discussion points:**

* **Inflation** has not hit the economy yet, but this weeks earnings will start showing hints of it.
* Inflation if not controlled can impact **liquidity** (can impact 401k contributions, DCA contributions etc...)
* **War is never cheap** and thought it can give short term bursts of boosts to stock markets with rumors.
* **Debt** is good until it is within means - i.e. Debt < GDP
* **Risk fatigue is real** \- Your month on month contributions are being blindly invested in those target funds without risk readings taken into considerations and rug pulls are not uncommon.
* **AI bubble** is similar to the dot com bubble - those who know it, know it that dot com investments went beyond the realistic capabilities that were not realized until 10-15 years down the line but by then the bubble burst and took 10-12 years to recover.

2025-06-23 13:47:17,reddit,Opportunities in the short-term market volatility? I'm sharing a low-risk offensive strategy that I've been tracking recently,"Over the past few weeks, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, ""The direction is unclear and we dare not act."" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.

Recently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:

After determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.

Place an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).

Auxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.

Last week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.

I wouldn't say this is a ""sure-win strategy"", but its advantage lies in:

The risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage

CEO Adam Goldstein said it’s *“a step toward bringing our Midnight aircraft to skies around the world,”* which honestly sounds like more progress than I expected at this stage

It’s not just the FAA now, they’re trying to line things up globally, which could be a huge advantage if they’re first

They’ve also got their first Midnight deliveries scheduled for this summer in the UAE ***(Abu Dhabi Aviation + Ethiopian Airlines),*** and just announced a new software partnership with Palantir to build out aviation systems. So it looks like they’re stacking the pieces: hardware, software, and regulatory.

Financials are still rough, last quarter they reported a $93M net loss, but they’ve got over $1B in cash and just raised another $850M. So runway isn’t the issue right now. The bigger question is how fast they can move from testing to actual paid operations.

Still zero revenue, obviously, but the article points out they’re leading the sector and up over 220% in the last year. Volatile, but seems like they’re ahead of the other players in terms of actual execution.

Not saying I’m all in, but this feels different from the typical “flying car” hype. Curious if anyone here is holding or watching it too.

>The Danish drugmaker said Monday it would no longer provide Hims & Hers with direct access to its FDA-approved weight loss drug Wegovy through NovoCare Pharmacy. The partnership, which was expanded just last month in April, had aimed to make obesity treatments more accessible and affordable for Americans.

>According to Novo Nordisk, the decision comes after Hims & Hers allegedly failed to comply with laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs. The pharmaceutical company accused the telehealth provider of ""disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk.""

>""Novo Nordisk is firm on our position and protecting patients living with obesity,"" said Dave Moore, Executive Vice President of US Operations at Novo Nordisk. ""When patients are prescribed semaglutide treatments by their licensed healthcare professional or a telehealth provider, they are entitled to receive authentic, FDA-approved and regulated Wegovy.""

>The original collaboration, announced in April, had offered Americans access to Wegovy through the Hims & Hers platform at a unified price starting at $599 per month, which included the medication along with 24/7 care, clinical support, and nutrition guidance.

>Novo Nordisk expressed concerns about ""knock-off drugs"" made with foreign ingredients, specifically citing suppliers from China that have not been authorized by the FDA to manufacture semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy.

For context, I recently finished college and have started working. I’m in the 24% tax bracket and my CPA and I aren’t too worried about me getting into the 32% bracket. I have one full time job that gives me a W-2 and a contract job that gives me a 1099. 

The problem is that my W-2 job won’t allow in service 401K conversions making it not possible to convert it into a roth IRA at least while i’m still working there. I’m hoping that setting up a solo 401K with a company (i.e., vangaurd or fidelity) that allows in service conversions will allow me to contribute and convert more than $7000 a year to my Roth IRA. 

My CPA has advised that I also write off as many expenses as I can from my contract job as the self-employment tax is quite high. He also stated that the maximum I can contribute to my solo 401K is only 20% of whatever my net income from the contract job is meaning if I make $20,000 from my contract job a year I can only contribute and then convert $4000 (not taking into account the tax on that $4000). He is not sure if I can take my after-tax money from my W-2 job contribute as an after-tax contribution to my solo 401K. He is under the impression that it can only be the wages gained from my contract job. He was also worried about me maxing out my 401K at my W2 job and contributing to my solo 401K at the same time, but if I’m trying to convert everything in my solo 401K it should be fine?

He’s going to do more research before getting back to me. I was doing research through the White Coat Investor so I believe it is possible. I just want to see if anyone else has done this or has any comments/advice to offer. I hope to cross check what my CPA says when he gets back to me in a couple weeks.

Basically, they've been given until 2027 to remove 40 substances - including bleached flour and artificial dyes.

What hit me was that High Fructose Corn Syrup did not make the warnings list.

2025-06-23 03:23:18,reddit,"Why EQT will benefit from AI, Iran War, and Trump Tariffs","EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the U.S.

Not going to bore you with financial metrics, so I will keep this thesis concise.

1. Natural gas is the primary marginal fuel for U.S. power generation, which will support AI datacenter expansion (not nuclear, at least this decade).
2. Roughly 20% of global LNG flows through the Strait of Hormuz. Any disruption could drive up global LNG prices, pulling more U.S. supply into export markets and tightening domestic balances - bullish for Henry Hub and EQT’s unhedged volumes.
3. Trump-era policy was broadly favorable to fossil fuels. While tariffs could pressure steel-intensive capex (e.g., pipelines), the trade-off is likely faster permitting, LNG approvals, and pro-drilling rhetoric.
4. EQT’s disciplined hedging strategy, strong capital return framework, and ongoing basis risk from pipeline constraints shape its risk/reward profile - limiting upside in price spikes, but providing stable cash flow and shareholder returns.

It's one of the best plays on U.S. gas demand growth, geopolitical optionality, and Trumpian regulatory shifts.

2025-06-22 23:19:13,reddit,Is It Actually Moral and Good to Invest In Evil Companies?,"There is an assumption for most people that ethical investing involves not investing in companies that one deems (personally) immoral. The types of companies one deems immoral will be different for every investor, but is not important for this question. Question is: For someone that cares about a certain issue, is it actually *better* to invest in that company, reap the rewards, and then use the rewards for your cause, than to not invest at all?

  
For example, let's say your biggest issue is climate change. If you invest, let's say, $1K in Exxon Mobil, the benefit to Exxon is essentially *nil*\---you are buying the stock from another person, not the company; the only real impact is a totally negligible increase to the share price (I guess... And I guess of like a theoretical 0.00000000000000000000001%?). A few years later, you sell your investment, which is now worth $1.5K. With the $500 profit, you can donate to a green energy non-profit, use the money to help buy solar panels, etc..---direct forms of support which almost certainly have a much greater positive effect than the buying of the stock had a negative effect. So essentially you are buying a stock from someone (who is probably pro-fossil fuels, and whose consumption patterns would probably align to that---i.e., would use the money they make to make the problem even worse) and now having it be owned by yourself, who will take the increased valuation of this company over time and use it *against them* at a much higher impact multiplier.

  
What are the problems with this argument? I'm not sure I totally agree with it, but I currently find it at least as persuasive as the ""investing in bad stock = bad because complicit"" argument.",positive,0.9771650433540344,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1li1m2h/is_it_actually_moral_and_good_to_invest_in_evil/,

2025-06-22 22:28:25,reddit,Investing a substantial forgivable loan - liquidity and tax considerations,"Burner account because obviously.

I have been offered a substantial forgivable loan from a company, and I'm debating how I would invest the proceeds. The loan is $500,000 total, and I would receive that amount at the inception of the loan. 1/5 of the loan would be forgiven each year for the next five years, assuming I'm still employed at the company. The loan has an interest rate that is equal to the lowest interest rate permitted by the IRS for an 5-year term arm's length loan (currently about 4%), and the accrued interest to date would be forgiven each year in the same manner as the corresponding principal amount as described above. Every time a tranche of the loan is forgiven, I have to pay taxes on the forgiven amount at that time, which is taxed as ordinary income.

.

The substantial risk here is that if I leave the company (or am laid off) during the term of the loan, I have to pay back the non-forgiven principal and interest accrued to date within 30 days. So I need to be pretty liquid with the investment. The goal is therefore to meet or beat the 4% interest rate (ideally, post-tax) but maintain at least pretty good liquidity.

.

In the immediate term, my candidate solution is to invest in individual municipal bonds with a maturity date right before the first tranche of the loan is forgiven (in about a year). Current rates on such municipal bonds I'm seeing are roughly 5%, and they are not subject to federal income taxes, which is a substantial perk. When those bonds mature, I would reassess and probably lean towards reinvesting the proceeds in municipal bonds again with about a one year term.

.

There is liquidity risk in that I could be compelled to repay the loan before those municipal bonds mature, but there are three considerations that mitigate this:

(1) I think it's very unlikely I would separate or be separated from the company within the next six months. Probably if I am separated from the company, the most likely time would be as we approach the date of the first tranche being forgiven.

(2) Municipal bonds can be sold on the secondary market, so I could liquidate early if necessary. Granted, if interest rates go up (and that seems likely!), I might have to sell at a loss, but the volatility here is less than the stock market.

(3) I have the capacity to liquidate other stock investments and/or take out short-term loans (e.g. until the bonds mature) to repay the loan if necessary.

.

So, thoughts? Can you come up with a better solution? It's an interesting problem and not one that I've been able to find much about online. Thank you!",positive,0.9999586343765259,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1li0iw9/investing_a_substantial_forgivable_loan_liquidity/,

I know market conditions can change (e.g., market under or overperforms, not contributing the full max, etc.), so not banking that this will be the exact numbers by the time I reach a couple of these milestones.

* **Starting balance**: $395,340.74 (What I've accumulated the last 8.5 - 9 years).
* **Starting salary**: $91,500 (In addition to employer match of 5% and salary base increase of 2% annually)
* **Annual contribution**: $23,500
* **Annual return**: 7%

I'll contribute for 25 years, then let time and returns carry my portfolio through the final 8 years.

|Age|Year-End Balance|Inflation-Adjusted (2.5%)|Inflation-Adjusted (3%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|40|**$395,340.74**|**$488,346**|**$448,346**|
|65|**$13,596,296**|**$8,662,337**|**$4,861,277**|
|72|**$23,125,326**|**$12,648,090**|**$6,866,508**|

**Summary**:

Just for context: I could adjust this for inflation or make it conservative at even 5%-6%, but the numbers are encouraging IF things stay the way they are. I plan to start Roth conversions in my personal Roth IRA at 60 and hopefully will help minimize large tax bill and remain in a desirable tax bracket by then.

But obviously it'll be better to sell before the war, buy again at the low and hold again.

For obvious reasons...

But right now I'm confused what should be my current move looking at the market.

Plz enlighten me I'm new to all this. 

Thank you in advance 

Also tell me your views on crypto (if you can I'd love to talk about it)

Edit:- 

I'm sorry if I sound as if I'm worried... No... I know there will be no war, even if there's a war things will get back to normal.

All i meant was I want to know how to take advantage of situations like these 

Because 90% of the people start believing this and sell so I want to take advantage of this fact and benefit from it.

2025-06-22 18:14:37,reddit,Advice about ethical investing?,"
So, for context, I’m from Spain and almost 30. I started investing around two years ago, when I didn’t really know how it worked. My biggest investment was my current house, which I bought for around 200,000€, and I’ve also put some money into the stock market sporadically (around 3,000€ total), investing in the classics like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Coca-Cola, by buying individual stocks through Revolut, not funds or ETFs. 

I never invested in Tesla, Netflix, and some other companies because they go against my values (Elon Musk, subscription services, gas or arms companies, etc.). But over time, I’ve realized that many of the companies I have invested in don’t align with my morals either, especially after some of them publicly supported Trump (Meta, Amazon, etc.) or Israel (Carrefour, McDonald’s, and many more).

Now I’m dealing with an internal conflict. I want to make money, but not by supporting unethical companies. I’ve noticed that a lot of funds and ETFs also include these companies in different proportions, and the ones that don’t often don’t perform well. So it’s hard to find ways to invest that feel both profitable and principled.

I guess my questions are: how do you align your values with your investments? Do you think there’s a middle ground, and if so, how do you find it? Do you have any recommendations for specific companies, funds, or ETFs that are both ethical and profitable? Or would it make more sense to put the money into a high-yield savings account, crypto, gold, or something else?

All feedback is welcome.

2025-06-22 15:33:44,reddit,$60K on TSLA Puts:  Why TSLA Will Be Down Big Next Few Weeks.,"In no particular order:

- Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely a sell-the-news event anyways.

- Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks.  TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money.

- TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September.  This is a huge precedent which now means TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods.  Waymo will continue to expand faster than TSLA.

- Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings.  Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world.  Analyst downgrades are coming.  TSLA will likely lower full year guidance.

- I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond.  It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars.

- Elon is still popping off about one of Mango’s closest White House aides.  The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant.

- $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year.

- Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further.  High P/E stocks like TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.

How’s it going for you?,"Hi all, I’m in my late 20s, working a pretty standard tech job (did a few years in retail before that). Sometime last year, I was fortunate enough to receive a mid to high 5 figure inheritance from family. At first, I let the bank’s advisors handle it, but honestly the returns were pretty underwhelming. So I decided to start learning on the side on my own. Taught myself the basics of investing, lots of youTube, books and lurking on this sub haha.

Fast forward to a year now, and I’ve managed to grow my little inheritance to just over six figures. Nothing crazy, but I’m pretty proud considering I started with zero experience and just learned as I went. I’m still keeping things pretty conservative (mostly index funds, some blue-chip stocks, and a bit of crypto for fun).

My main goal is to save up for a down payment on a property in the next few years, so I’m trying to balance growth with not taking on too much risk.

Curious if anyone else here is in a similar boat, either got a windfall, received an inheritance or just decided to take the DIY route with their investments. How’s it going for you? How long have you been managing your own portfolio, and what’s been your biggest lesson so far?

2025-06-22 04:03:00,reddit,Historical Prices vs Historical Performance Claims,"I need some help on the stock system as a whole. I'm doing some research on stock price history. 

In the period from 1980 to 1990, several stocks were considered ""best performers"", including USB, Circuit City, Nike, and some others. Nike is listed as having a 23,000% return. Circuit City was supposed to have a 90x return. USB is listed as a 22,000% return. 

But when I review the historical prices... I don't see where those returns come from. 

Take USB:  
Jan 1980 price about $0.70   
Dec 1989 price about $2.35 (3x increase)

Stock splits  
1984 1.1 for 1  
1985 2 for 1  
1989 2 for 1 (roughly 5.5x cumulative)

All that together is roughly a 1500% return. 

There are dividends, roughly quarterly. So that might account for it. Some are into the forty cents a share and some are not even a dime per share. 

NIKE is even worse though.   
Jan 1981 price about $0.16  
Dec 1989 price about $0.87 (5.5x increase)

1x 2:1 stock split in the entire decade

6x $0.10 and 1x $0.15 dividend the entire decade. 

How does anyone get a 23000% return from that?

2025-06-21 18:50:25,reddit,Lumpsum inheritance vs keep for rental property,"So in a situation where my parents passed away and their home, still having an $80,000 mortgage on a (Zillow) value of $270,000.

My current situation is 38 year old with ~$600,000 in investments between 401k, Roth IRA, Crypto, brokerage, HSA, and HYSA.  Currently I'm fortunate enough to max out my 401k, Roth IRA for myself and spouse, max HSA, and have some extra I put into brokerage accounts monthly. Also we have a primary residence with a mortgage at 3.375% interest, current mortgage value is around 50% of current home vaule.

I'm trying to decide on of I should sell the inherited home and take the lump sum to invest in brokerage or keep the house as a rental property.  Based on my numbers I think I have to get a new mortgage on the rental property around $120,000 to do some home improvements before it's ready to rent.  Expected rent would be around $1,800-$1,900 and I would prefer to use a property management company to stay as hands off as I could.

My mind is telling me it's be good to keep property as a rental for future passive income and maybe the first stepping stone into a few rentals down the line.  However it's hard for me to not just take the lump sum and grow it at 7%-10% per year in the market.

2025-06-21 16:03:55,reddit,Potential conflict of interest from wealth management company,"Hey folks, my girlfriend recently asked me to take a look at her managed investment portfolio to get a second opinion, and I found something a bit strange. A sizable amount of her portfolio was recently invested in a very new ""actively managed fund"" that I had never heard of, ticker FFOX.

Upon further inspection, there are a few odd things that jumped out:  
\- 1% Expense Ratio.  
\- Nearly half of the fund is just a collection of other ETFs.  
\- It is owned and managed by the same wealth management company.  
\- The expense ratio is buried way at the bottom of the fund’s site, and holdings are listed alphabetically (so it’s easy to miss that most of the fund is just other ETFs).

After I learned this, I asked my girlfriend to get in touch with her parents, who use the same wealth management company, and it turns out they also have a chunky amount of money invested in this fund. Neither of them were informed about this move.

This strikes me as a massive conflict of interest, and straight up shady business practice.

For whatever reason(s), I couldn't close the position and remove it from my portfolio, but I'll be the first to admit I know little to nothing about chapter 11 bankruptcy law and it's interaction with stock markets.

However, I just came across some news articles that after SunPower sold its assets to Complete Solaria, Complete Solaria is actually reviving and rebrand to the old SunPower name: https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2025/04/23/sunpower-rises-again/. Although the articles states ""The company’s ticker symbol will change from “CSLR” and “CSLRW” to “SPWR” and “SPWRW”, respectively, effective April 22, 2025"" the SPWR symbol still seems to be going: https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SPWR:NASDAQ

Also SunPower has regained Nasdaq compliance, reporting Q1 profits, being it's first profitable quarter in three years, and to returning solar panel and installation sales: https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/05/06/sunpower-regains-nasdaq-compliance-reports-q1-profit/.

With this news, could Robinhood or other brokerages reactivate the SunPower trading? Once all the Nasdaq re-filling kinks are worked out. Those lingering $0.0001 shares look a bit out in my portfolio, lol.

I also found this trading symbol change notice in https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=55054  that *""SunPower Corporation (SPWR) will change its trading symbol to SPWRQ effective August 16, 2024, dueto the listing of the company on an OTC market. As a result, option symbol SPWR will change to SPWRQ effective at the opening of business on August 16, 2024.""* Again, August 2024 has come and gone and the SPWRQ stock hasn't budged.

However, one redditor stated: ""Equity owners (shareholders) are typically wiped out in bankruptcies. All the asset sales are going to the creditors."" - https://www.reddit.com/r/SunPower/comments/1g6mo5r/what_to_do_with_sunpower_stock/lskcr2p/

Ok, fair enough, if it's gone, it's gone, built I would like to get some clarity what's going on, if possible. The fact that the ""new"" SPWRQ stock is still $0.0001 means Complete Solaria rebranding/takeover hasn't completed?

Snap acquired Saturn, a social calendar app popular with students. Saturn reaches 80% of U.S. high schoolers, boosting Snap’s teen market dominance.

1.  Teen Engagement: Saturn’s integration may increase time spent on Snapchat, as teens open it 30+ times daily.

2.  Global Reach: With 443M daily users, Snap grows fastest in India (36% of users). Saturn could expand to similar markets.

3.  Monetization: Ad revenue hit $1.37B in Q3 2024; Saturn’s data could refine ad targeting. Snapchat+ (9M subscribers) may add Saturn features.

4.  AR/AI: Saturn could leverage Snap’s AR and AI for interactive scheduling, keeping teens hooked.


Snap struggles to retain older users but has strategies:

1.  Evolving Needs: Saturn’s tools for college and young adults could retain users transitioning to work.

2.  Feature Growth: Stories, Memories, and Snapchat+ cater to maturing users; Saturn adds utility.

3.  Competition: Snapchat competes with Instagram and TikTok but excels in authenticity. Saturn’s niche strengthens its edge.",neutral,0.9945793151855469,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lgdj52/snap_acquires_sature_social_calendar/,

2025-06-20 14:54:49,reddit,US Prepares Action Targeting Allies’ Chip Plants in China (WSJ),"By Liza Lin, Amrith Ramkumar and Raffaele Huang

(Wall Street Journal) -- A U.S. official told top global semiconductor makers he wanted to revoke waivers they have used to access American technology in China, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could inflame trade tensions.

Currently, South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing enjoy blanket waivers that allow them to ship American chip-making equipment to their factories in China without applying for a separate license each time.

Jeffrey Kessler, head of the unit in charge of export controls at the Commerce Department, told the three companies this week he wanted to cancel those waivers, according to people familiar with the meetings. They said Kessler described the action as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on critical U.S. technology going to China.

If carried out, the move could be disruptive both diplomatically and economically. Earlier this month, the U.S. and China agreed to a fragile trade truce in London. Part of the deal involved each country agreeing to hold off from introducing new export controls and other measures designed to hurt the other.

The action isn't a new trade escalation but would be designed to make the licensing system for chip equipment similar to what China has in place for rare-earth materials, White House officials said. The U.S. and China continue to make progress on completing the agreement they reached in London and negotiating on trade, they said.

""Chip makers will still be able to operate in China. The new enforcement mechanisms on chips mirror licensing requirements that apply to other semiconductor companies that export to China and ensure the United States has an equal and reciprocal process,"" a Commerce Department spokesman said.

A new step making it harder for global chip makers to operate in China might still strike Beijing as a betrayal of the London deal. It could also strain the relationship between Washington and friendly governments in South Korea and Taiwan, whose companies would be most affected and have promised large investments in the U.S. in recent years.

The Chinese factories in question -- including a Samsung memory-chip factory in the Chinese city of Xi'an -- are part of the global supply chain for memory, logic and other chips. While they generally don't have the most advanced technology, the factories' output is widely used in cars, consumer electronics and the like.

Industry officials said tighter curbs by Washington wouldn't immediately force the factories to shut down, but over time, they could find it harder to operate effectively. That would disrupt global industry as companies are dealing with other issues triggered by the U.S.-China trade war, such as China's limits on exports of rare-earth magnets.

The chip makers would likely seek case-by-case licenses from the U.S. government to supply their Chinese factories, while looking to replace U.S. equipment with alternatives from Japan and Europe.

People involved in the discussions said revoking the waivers isn't a done deal.

They said Kessler's unit -- the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security -- hasn't secured buy-in from other parts of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Department. Opponents in the administration worry eliminating the waivers would ultimately end up boosting Chinese companies and give China control of the plants.

Kessler and other national-security hawks have taken a hard line on cutting off China from American technologies, arguing that aggressive measures are needed to limit the country's advances in critical sectors and spur development of supply chains outside China. Those efforts have put them in conflict with pro-business officials.

In recent weeks, the administration has halted sales to China of more high-end chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. That has dented the U.S. companies' revenue by billions of dollars. Commerce also weighed broad restrictions on sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, although a White House official said that move was no longer under consideration.

The South Korean and Taiwanese companies have notified authorities in their home regions about the waiver issue, hoping for help lobbying against the move, people familiar with the discussions said.

Both South Korea and Taiwan are negotiating broader trade deals with Washington, part of a wave of agreements the Trump administration hopes to wrap up in the coming weeks.

The companies see their Chinese factories as important for competing against Chinese rivals, which are looking to win more global business as chip suppliers. Samsung's current U.S. waiver has allowed its Xi'an plant to make some advanced products that compete against China's Yangtze Memory Technologies, among others.

South Korea, a U.S. military ally, and Taiwan have worked with the U.S. in its technology race with China, including by limiting transfer of advanced technology to China. TSMC, Samsung and SK Hynix have all made multibillion-dollar investments in U.S. factories with backing from Washington.",positive,0.9989612102508545,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lg60qm/us_prepares_action_targeting_allies_chip_plants/,WSJ

2025-06-20 13:51:15,reddit,Tesla Robotaxi Launch: We Were All Wrong (and VW has one now),"I made a speculative post about how Phony Stark would delay the Robotaxi launch and there were lots of other good guesses on how they would fake it (ala- human in a robot suit tactics). We had things like relays back to HQ to operate them like drones, tail cars, AI (actually Indians), and other ways humans would operate them. Well... It looks like they are going to go through with it and it's even worse than we all thought. They are just going to put a human operator inside the cars! Not kidding...

Source: [https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/](https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/)

I am going to need to see a picture of the passenger side floorboard. If they don't put a physical brake pedal in there like all the drivers ed cars have retrofitted in them, you know the human operator will have something like a game controller or button on them to apply the brakes. Classic Elon and Tesla.

Given that the only people riding in these Roboscams are known Tesler fanboys that were invited because of their past posts on X, I am sure the reviews will be nothing short of fantastic. Here is one I can foresee:

""*I felt perfectly safe riding in the awesome new Tesla Robotaxi! The ride was so smooth. I barely felt the bump when we ran over the little kid getting off the school bus and it didn't delay my trip at all after the AI just kept us going.*""

In other news: VW, without feeling the need to spread propaganda ahead of time, just unveiled their production ID. Buzz AD robotaxi. Yeah. That small car company. And it's awesome.

Along with being an actual purpose design and built robotaxi instead of just a Jerrry-rigged older model, it has three things Tesla doesn't:

1. Nine LiDAR sensors (and five radars- so it doesn't crash into things).
2. Space for actual passengers- a key feature to taxis.
3. Level 4 autonomy.

I love the Tesla fan perspective on LiDAR: ""It's expensive"" and ""It's not needed with an AI-driven 100% vision system"". Yeah right. Let's see it work then. We've only been waiting a decade now. If Tesla can solve all of the world's hardest technological problems and are the world's best at manufacturing (as Elon states), then why can't they design and build their own simple LiDAR sensors for their cars? They can't make a better version of the sensor I can buy online for a few hundred bucks that goes into a golf range finder but they are going to make a humanoid robot? One of those things is really hard to do. The other isn't.

Tesla is so far behind in this space. I can't believe there are still enough gullible people still falling for the narrative to pump the stock. Their own internal analysis said this endeavor would lose money. At this point I think there are only three types of people:

1. Aware.
2. Blind Believers (aka- cult members).
