2025-06-17 19:59:24,reddit,Buy BioNTech BNTX r/BNTX r/BioNTech now with huge upside potential on future drugs?,"**Investment Recommendation: BioNTech BNTX** r/BNTX r/BioNTech 

**Buy Recommendation:**  
BioNTech presents an attractive investment opportunity in future cancer treatment with >20 drugs in development pipeline, strongly supported by its exceptional cash position and robust financial health.

**Key Reasons**

**Outstanding Cash Reserves:**  
As of March 31, 2025, BioNTech holds approximately EUR 15.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments, providing unmatched financial flexibility within the biotech sector. Now, you can further add the unconditional USD 1.5bln cash from Bristol Myers Squibb. Results in amazing 19.5bln USD. This liquidity ensures the company can confidently fund its ambitious R&D pipeline, strategic acquisitions, and future growth without relying on external financing. Now compare this with the current market cap of USD 25.5bln. Besides, BMY will pay further USD 2bln until 2028.

**Financial Strength and Stability:**  
BioNTech‚Äôs balance sheet remains among the strongest in the industry, with more cash than debt and a current ratio above 10, highlighting its ability to cover all short-term obligations and invest aggressively in innovation.

**Strategic Growth Potential:**  
The company is actively advancing late-stage oncology assets and expanding its product pipeline, leveraging its cash reserves to drive acquisitions and partnerships that position it as a future leader in immuno-oncology. More than 20 active Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, several of which are already in Phase 3. including global Phase 3 studies for small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, as well as ‚Äì starting at the end of 2025 ‚Äì for triple-negative breast cancer.

The leading immunotherapy candidate, BNT327, for example, is being investigated in several global Phase 3 studies that have the potential for approval, particularly in various types of lung cancer. Other programs, such as antibody-drug conjugates like BNT325/DB-1305, are also in advanced clinical development.

Timing of the first commercial products: BioNTech plans to submit its first marketing authorization application for a cancer immunotherapy by the end of 2025. If successful and approved by the authorities, the first commercial products could come to market as early as 2026.

**Analyst Confidence:**  
Multiple analysts maintain a Buy rating, citing the company‚Äôs large cash position as a key reason for optimism and raising price targets in anticipation of future growth and diversification beyond COVID-19 vaccines. The average price target for 2025 is around 140 US dollars. Estimates range from around 118 to 175 US dollars. The majority of analysts are clearly in favor of a buy: Around 74-80% recommend the share as a buy, the rest as a hold, there are no sell recommendations

**Conclusion**

BioNTech‚Äôs substantial cash reserves provide a solid foundation for long-term value creation, making the stock an appealing buy for investors seeking both security and growth potential in the cancer treatment and biotech sector.",neutral,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ldx7p0/buy_biontech_bntx_rbntx_rbiontech_now_with_huge/,BNTX

2025-06-17 19:07:40,reddit,"Meta to release smart glasses with Oakley and Prada, extending Luxottica partnership","Meta¬†and¬†EssilorLuxottica¬†plan to release versions of their AI-powered smart glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands, CNBC has learned.

The addition of Prada and Oakley underscore the breakout success Meta had with its second-generation Ray-Ban glasses released in partnership with Luxottica in 2023. The Oakley expansion will be done in partnership with Luxottica, while the addition of Prada signifies Meta‚Äôs first step toward bring its wearable hardware to more fashion companies.¬†

Meta on Monday teased the Oakley release on social media, launching an Instagram account for ‚ÄúOakley | Meta‚Äù with a profile description that reads ‚ÄúThe next evolution is coming on June 20.‚Äù

CNBC reviewed a document that says the new glasses with Luxottica will be¬†aimed¬†at athletes. Meta is¬†targeting¬†active consumers after seeing several owners of its Ray-Ban glasses use the device to record themselves playing tennis, skiing and doing other activities.

The Oakley version of the glasses may cost around $360 as they are more weather resistant than their Ray-Ban counterparts, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the upcoming device. The first version of the Oakley Meta glasses will feature similar technology to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses released in 2023.

Luxottica, based in France and Italy, has licensing arrangements with over 150 brands and owns notable brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.

Meta‚Äôs agreement with Prada comes after the fashion company in December renewed an eyewear-related¬†licensing agreement¬†with Luxottica for 10 years. That deals covers the ‚Äúdevelopment, production and worldwide distribution of eyewear under the Prada, Prada Linea Rossa and Miu Miu brands,‚Äù the companies said at the time.

Besides giving Meta a high-end partnership, the Prada glasses may be a particularly good fit for the tech company as many of the brand‚Äôs models come with thick temples, former Meta employees said. That provides more heft for housing many of the components necessary for smart glasses, including microphones and chips.

It‚Äôs¬†unclear when the Prada deal and product line will be announced.

Meta first partnered with EssilorLuxottica in 2019 to jointly develop the Ray-Ban glasses. The two companies released the first version in 2021, but they found success after the release of the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses in 2023. That version comes equipped with the Meta AI voice assistant and includes features and, when tethered to a smartphone, lets users identify city landmarks, get recipes when looking at ingredients and record and send voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger.

EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February the companies have sold 2 million pairs of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses since 2023. Miller said he aimed to increase annual production to 10 million units by the end of 2026.

Meta and Luxottica¬†announced¬†an extension of their partnership in October, with plans to release more versions of their Ray-Ban glasses. That deal was worth $5 billion, according to¬†a July 2024 report¬†in The Wall Street Journal. As part of the deal, Meta gets exclusive rights to Luxottica‚Äôs brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.¬†

The two companies plan to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC has previously reported.

Competition in the market is heating up.

Last month,¬†Alphabet¬†announced¬†a $150 million partnership¬†with¬†Warby Parker¬†that will see the two companies team up to release glasses infused with Google‚Äôs Gemini AI assistant. The companies plan to release the glasses sometime after 2025.¬†

Snap, meanwhile, announced in June that it plans to release its sixth generation smart glasses under a new brand called Specs. Those glasses, expected for release in 2026, will include augmented-reality technology and will be smaller and lighter than Snap‚Äôs prior products, Snap said.¬†

Meta declined to comment. Luxottica and Prada could not be reached.

Bloomberg News first¬†reported¬†about the Oakley Meta glasses in January.

2025-06-17 17:16:00,reddit,LMT will build your fighter jet to the moon,"A basic summary of why I believe LMT will get you some sweet, sweet tendies.

**Government Money Printer:** Lockheed Martin is basically a defense money printer backed by Uncle Sam‚Äôs infinite budget. Geopolitical chaos = more tendies (contracts) for LMT.

**Growth Catalysts:** Record $176 BILLION backlog of orders, rising defense budgets, constant tech upgrades (think hypersonics, next-gen fighters).

**Fundamentals:** ~17√ó forward P/E, solid free cash flow (~4‚Äì5% yield), and a ~2.7‚Äì2.8% dividend yield. Not cheap, but for a steady cash cow that‚Äôs printing money, it‚Äôs a bargain.

**Dividends & Buybacks:** 22 years of dividend hikes and ~$3.7B buybacks last year. Total shareholder yield ~6% = tendies on autopilot.

**Peers:** RTX, NOC, GD are cool, but LMT is the Chad of defense stocks. Fatter dividend, steadier pipeline.

**Risks (LOL):** If WW3 doesn‚Äôt happen, defense spending could slow = fewer tendies. But otherwise, government can‚Äôt stop feeding this beast with contracts.

Listen up degenerates. Lockheed Martin, ticker LMT, is a boomer stonk that might quietly send us to financial Valhalla. This isn't some speculative YOLO play on meme tech or fantasy crypto. LMT is a $100 billion defense juggernaut that prints money every time the world gets spicy.

Why should you care? Because war equals money and LMT is war in stock form. It makes jets, missiles, satellites, and space lasers. When the world loses its mind, LMT picks up the phone and gets paid. This is a stock that runs on government spending and global conflict. It‚Äôs not sexy. It‚Äôs not hype. But it‚Äôs steady and rich with tendies.

If you want long-term upside with fat dividends and real-world staying power, stop looking at space monkeys and start looking at military contractors. LMT is the kind of stonk you keep in your 401k and smile while it makes you rich.

**GROWTH CATALYSTS**

**Geopolitical Tensions Mean Free Money:** Every global conflict ends up funding LMT‚Äôs bottom line. From Ukraine to Taiwan to the Red Sea, the more chaos we get, the more cash they receive.

**Backlog is Stupidly Huge:** That $176 billion backlog covers years of work already booked. Even if the world chills out, Lockheed has enough orders lined up to coast comfortably.

**Tech Leadership is Real:** They make the F35 stealth jet, missiles, Black Hawk helicopters, and are deep in hypersonic weapon research. Their Skunk Works division is literal Iron Man factory mode.

**Global Customer Base:** International allies want Lockheed gear. Japan, Australia, the UK, and Middle Eastern states are placing major orders. If the US ever slows spending, foreign contracts keep the lights on.

**VALUATION AND FUNDMWALS**

**P/E Ratio:** LMT trades at around 20 times trailing earnings and about 17 times forward earnings. That‚Äôs fair for something this stable. The S&P500 average is higher right now.

**Cash Flow:** Over $5 billion in free cash flow last year. That‚Äôs real cash they use to pay dividends, fund buybacks, and develop future weapons. FCF yield is healthy around 4 to 5 percent.

**Dividends:** Current yield is about 2.8 percent. They‚Äôve raised the dividend 22 years in a row. Every quarter you get $3.30 per share. Your boomer uncle was right. This stuff pays.

**Buybacks:** $3.7 billion worth of shares repurchased last year. When the company buys its own shares and sends cash to shareholders, you get paid just to hold.

**Balance Sheet:** Debt is manageable. Cash on hand is strong. The government basically underwrites them so they can borrow cheap and grow steady.

**DIVIDEND INCOME**

**That Sweet Yield:** At 2.8 percent, Lockheed pays more than the S&P average and more than its main competitors. You‚Äôre getting paid quarterly just to hold.

**Dividend Growth:** It goes up almost every year. They‚Äôve tripled the dividend over the last decade. In five years, you could be getting $16 per share annually.

**Reinvest or Spend:** DRIP it and grow your position. Or take the cash and buy actual chicken tenders. Either way, the income stacks up.

**COMPANY COMPARABLES: LOOK AT THE BALLS ON LMT** 

**Raytheon:** Also makes missiles and radar. Good company but hit by jet engine recall drama. Lower dividend and more exposure to commercial aerospace.

**Northrop Grumman:** They build stealth bombers and dabble in space. Cool stuff but less diversified. Smaller dividend. Earnings more lumpy.

**General Dynamics:** Think tanks and submarines. Reliable, but slower growth. Also builds Gulfstream private jets. Half defense, half luxury.

**Lockheed Martin:** Bigger. More consistent. Dominates air systems and hypersonics. Broader contracts and deeper order book. Also the fattest dividend in the group.

**RISK ANALYSIS**

**World Peace:** Not likely, but if it happens, defense stocks could lag. Probably worth it for humanity though.

**US Budget Cuts:** If a future administration slashes defense, Lockheed could feel it. But international orders help cover the gap.

**Program Screwups:** They took a $2 billion loss on a classified project in 2024. Mistakes happen. Big programs have big risks.

**Competition:** If someone builds a better missile or fighter, Lockheed could lose out. But their R&D spend is massive, so they‚Äôre not sleeping.

**Macro Doom:** Market crashes drag everything down. Defense is defensive, but not immune.

Lockheed Martin is my favorite boomer tendie printer. It‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs predictable. But it‚Äôs been quietly making investors rich for decades.

Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long:

+A massive backlog of orders

+A rising dividend that pays every quarter

+Reliable government contracts

+Reasonable valuation and strong cash flows

+Fat buybacks and shareholder love",positive,0.6779037714004517,https://i.redd.it/feeqpskdti7f1.jpeg,LMT

2025-06-17 16:33:35,reddit,Sell rental property or keep it?,"Hi All,
I‚Äôm in a financial dilemma and was wondering if there is a different perspective I might be missing here.

I have a rental property that I‚Äôm thinking about selling but I have positive rental income on it currently. 

Here are my financials:

Single, no kids
(Want to get married and have kids in the next 3-4yrs)
Income from job: 160K annually
Primary residence details: 
Mortgage: $672K
Value of primary home: $750K
Rate: 6.25%
Monthly payment: $4900

Primary home is in a developing area, potential for value increase, good school district. Most importantly, I absolutely love living here.


Rental property details:
Mortgage: $332K at 2.75%
Value of rental property: $640K
Monthly mortgage payment and expenses $2050
Monthly rent( after property management fees): $3000

Other financials:
Retirement savings: $190K
Taxable savings: $72K
HYSA: $17K
Debt: mortgages + Auto loan at 1.24% with a balance of $7.3K

I‚Äôve also invested in real estate by building a retirement home for my parents where they live ( outside the US) and the equity on that is ~$450K

Now the dilemma:
Option 1
I‚Äôve lived in the rental property as my primary residence until 2023 april ( at least 2yrs in the last 5yrs) so I won‚Äôt get taxed on capital gains upto $250K if I sold it before April 2026.
My renters are vacating in August 2025 so I was thinking I could sell it then. I would probably gain $270K that I‚Äôm thinking about paying down my current mortgage by $100K and investing the rest in HYSA and ETFs

Option 2 would be to keep renting and possibly incur additional expenses in the future. 
( may not be major expenses since I replaced my AC units and heater in the last 3yrs)
If the rates get lower on my primary home, I could refinance and pay off the loan with the excess funds or even refinance for 15yrs at a lower rate( but cash risky)


I bought my primary home in April 2024. I could move back into my rental property after a year and sell ny primary home but I‚Äôm not inclined to do that since I love living here. I bought this house based on certain future plans of starting a family but that didn‚Äôt work out and life had its own plans. But waking up to the sunlight and this beautiful home is kind of keeping me sane tbh. 

Any perspective appreciated.

So, followup question. As my RMD from my 403b will be here soon ( I'm 71) and we are both still working with a combined annual income of 211K  with no overhead other than a 20K mortgage which will be gone in 2 years if not paid off early, it's definitely not needed. Currently around 50K in savings.

Myself, earning 91K , social security 27K, small pension from 1970 job - $2,500 ( that seemed enormous back then)

Wife 58 yrs old earning 92K  - retirement is still several years off  & maxing out 403b as well.

My 403b is currently 260K & I am maxing it out & at current projections will top 400K in several years with roughly the same math for my wife's.

So, now to the meat of the matter, If I continue to work till my wife can retire in 4-6 years, I'll still be @ my RMD in under 2 years & all it will do is increase our taxable income. I know, worse problems to have but with no deductions & always taking the short form, I REALLY will hate increasing my Fed tax contribution.

OK, the promise is that when a company goes public, they ask public money to go bigger. People buy their stocks to own a portion of a company. You find a company that is profitable, so that the shares you have increase in value.

But why would I care if company makes profit? If I am selling stocks, I am selling those shares to someone else, not to the company. It is not like the company is going to share their profits with me while I am holding their stocks. I sell those stocks to someone else who is willing to pay.

Like, I buy shares of Microsoft for $10 in 90s. Then, Microsoft makes huge profit. Now their shares are $300. Why? Microsoft did not share their profits with me? The shares went up not because the profits are up, but people created demand.

‚ÄúLet me correct a misimpression: Eutelsat does not have financial difficulties: No. Eutelsat has a need for financing. There‚Äôs a difference,‚Äù Fallacher asserted. ‚ÄúWe need financing to develop the constellation and continue our growth, which has already started and has been significant, and to conserve this unique strategic capacity.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe at Eutelsat provide our OneWeb network in low Earth orbit that is sovereign and European. There is a real appetite for this sovereignty across the industry,‚Äù he added.

Indeed, Fallacher emphasised that Eutelsat‚Äôs OneWeb mega-constellation is benefitting by being a valid alternate to Elon Musk‚Äôs Starlink, noting: ‚ÄúIn the world now there are only two broadband [LEO] constellations in service: Starlink and OneWeb. What has happened in Ukraine and the recent statements of Musk, threatening a to stop work on a NASA contract, is an opportunity for us. Here we see what it means that an actor as key as that can threaten to stop service.‚Äù

Nevertheless, the need for extra financing is considerable. While there are numerous reports that Eutelsat is looking for around ‚Ç¨1.5 billion, this might not be sufficient. It is generally accepted that replenishing the OneWeb fleet of 650 craft will cost much more that ‚Ç¨1.5 billion.

Currently, I contribute 10% of my income to 401k and net \~$40k. I have no debt, and I live in (and plan to stay in) a LCOL area. The only commitment I have with that \~40k is a goal of maxing-out my Roth IRA every year on the first day possible. For now, I am investing my Roth IRA entirely into FXAIX.

  


For my taxable brokerage, I am interested in a growth-oriented portfolio that is most likely to leave me in a good spot toward the end of that 6‚Äì8-year time frame.



I have been weighing some different options over the past year as to what this portfolio should consist of. Here are some ETFs I have considered:





\-VOO

  


\-VTI





\-QQQM





\-VXUS





I also plan to incorporate a small Bitcoin hedge, likely \~3%.

  


Currently, my account is allocated at roughly \~77% VOO, \~20% QQQM, \~3% Bitcoin. Not the most diversified and admittedly skewed by recency bias, but seemingly high potential for growth within my time horizon. I have been DCA'ing thus far and plan to continue.

  


I have played around with the idea of some different allocations, switching to VTI instead of VOO to further diversify, incorporating international exposure, and dropping or even further increasing my exposure to QQQM. All have very valid pros and cons. My lack of a strict deadline leaves me favoring potential for growth over diversification. I plan to slowly become more risk adverse as moving out becomes closer.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

June 16 (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. solar energy companies tumbled in extended trade on Monday after Republicans who control the U.S. Senate Finance Committee unveiled changes to President Donald Trump's sweeping tax-cut and spending bill that would phase out solar, wind and energy tax credits by 2028.
Shares of Enphase Energy (ENPH.O), opens new tab, which makes solar inverters, dropped 15% in after hours trade. Solar panel sellers Sunrun (RUN.O), opens new tab and SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG.O), opens new tab both tumbled more than 20%. First Solar (FSLR.O), opens new tab l

The modified text of Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" also extends tax credits for hydro, nuclear and geothermal power to 2036.
Those and other changes will be debated by Senate Republicans as they try to move forward on an aggressive timeline to pass the legislation ahead of the July 4 U.S. holiday.
The potential blow for solar companies comes amid already weak U.S. residential demand for solar, due in part to high interest rates and metering reforms in top market California, which have reduced the credits customers receive for feeding excess electricity back into the grid.",positive,0.8651135563850403,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ld9x74/senate_committees_changes_to_tax_bill_slam_us/,Senate
2025-06-17 00:11:42,reddit,How do you identify a gambling problem before actually incurring big losses? Whats the difference between gambling and a legit strategy?,"I had this concern last night.  That what I am doing with the stock market is more gambling and I am just getting lucky.  I worry that I have a gambling problem.  But all the resources refer to more traditional gambling, losses, emotions, life issues, etc.  They dont really apply because I havent lost..... yet.  My life is better, not worse.  I am not emotional or thrill seeking.  But this could be due to being on a ""hot streak"".  Right?

For some background, this stared in 2020.  I got pissed at my retirement account management company because I was invested in the ""high risk, high reward"" profile and my account was underperforming the market by about 50%.  I asked the dude to explain himself and got some bullshit back.  I concluded that retirement fund managers are full of shit and just want to chill and collect expense ratio commissions.  So I pulled all money and invested it myself.  Exclusively S&P ETFs at the beginning.

I looked around for other good places to put my money because I was loosing confidence in the stock market.  Bonds looked like over-inflated trash as well.  Treasury notes were too little $$ allowed/year.  So I decided to try and beat the market with ""risky"" things and see what happens.  I started swing trading some more volatile securities and crypto.  I did take some meaningful losses in the beginning, but had a plan B in place that allowed me to recover those positions for profit.  I now have a somewhat quantifiable strategy (Not TA) with rules and conditions.  My results have been great. I have grown my retirement accounts by 4x since 2020 doing this (Over-performing market by 100%) and over-performing my shitty fund managers by 4x. 

This has now turned into my primary form of income outside of my retirement accounts.  I have been consistently making 2x what I did at my day job for 3 years now, so I have quit my day job because it started interfering with trading.  I didnt see a point in working 40 hours/week, hating my life, for 50% of what I make in the market.  I now spend 5-10 hours/week trading and about 30 hours a week thinking about trading and doing spreadsheets.  Im now incorporating selling covered calls against my holdings in order to further maximize gains.  I fully realize the limitations of my strategy and do not expect it to last forever.  My plan is to do this until my strategy becomes irrelevant, which I think will be 2 years.  Then either retire or go back to my career if I havent hit retirement goals.

Unfortunately, last night I started having intrusive thoughts about this being a gambling problem.  I do see a lot of similarities.  Could I loose everything tomorrow? No.  Not without civilization collapsing.  Am I betting the farm on everything?  Also no.  I have about 15 years of trading experience at this point.  I was playing with buying short-term options for a bit in the beginning, but stopped when I learned more and that those a guaranteed losses (-$10k, ouch).  The emotions I get are mild/moderate anxiety, especially when something goes south.  I feel almost nothing on wins.  Just some calmness and relief that things worked out.  I have plenty of patience waiting for 6 months for my strategy conditions to be met to buy again.  No trills, excitement, or sense of urgency.  Its more of a ""This opportunity is too good to pass up"" mindset, than a ""this is fun"" mindset.  I dont feel omnipotent or anything.  Just fortunate to have (maybe) figured something out that works.

This would indicate to me that my strategy is reliable and predictable, which is inherently not gambling.  But at the same time, this is all fake money to an extent.  I am not producing a product.  I am not doing useful work.  I am not generating value.  I am just playing a game with ambiguous rules and there absolutely is an element of luck and corruption dictating my results.  My money doesnt feel like real money anymore.  It feels fake.  I am still frugal with my spending and stuff.  I dont have expensive tastes.  Im really just looking to have experiences and live my life without having to deal with corporate assholes anymore.

So Im wondering if I need to stop this because its all going to come crashing down.  Or if I have trust issues with actually becoming successful at it.  Or if this is what ""professional trading"" actually looks like.  Right now my plan is to do this until my strategy is no longer relevant, which I think will be another 2 years.  Then either retire if I am wildly successful or go back to a normal career if I have not hit retirement goals.

Thoughts on this would be appreciated.  Thanks.",positive,0.9675970673561096,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ld91x2/how_do_you_identify_a_gambling_problem_before/,

****tl;dr if this post is boring , compounded growth> regular growth so invest for the long term as it‚Äôll catch up to anything given a long timeline. ****

But, it isn‚Äôt impossible to grow your invested amount by 1%/day compared to your original investment. For instance if you invested $100, making $1/day

So for fun I was curious how long would it take, when getting a 10% yearly return, until your expected daily growth is 1%/day ($1 in this example) 

And the cool thing is this takes under 40 years of investing, (with 10%/yoy) returns which yes is likely higher than future returns will be, but, is about what it‚Äôs been historically and the maths easy with 10%

And you‚Äôd never live this long, but it would only take about 85 years or so, to be making 100% of your original investment amount, per day.

* A study by Deutsche Bank shows that markets typically fall about 6% in the three weeks following a geopolitical shock, only to regain ground in the following three weeks. Historical precedent suggests that unless a conflict leads to a significant slowdown in economic growth or a spike in inflation - think oil embargoes in the 1970s or the Kuwait invasion in 1990 - it rarely leaves a lasting impact
* **Modest risk aversion:** High-yield credit spreads widened just 2 bps a sign of only mild caution.
* **Low positioning:** With equity exposure historically light, there‚Äôs less forced selling into weakness.
* **Oil‚Äôs muted response:** Brent crude hasn‚Äôt yet surged to levels that threaten growth or Fed rate-cut expectations
* Do you agree that markets are underestimating the risk until we see clear growth or inflation impacts?
* Are you adjusting your portfolio for geopolitical risk - e.g., cutting back on cyclical investments or adding defensive investments - or are you sticking to the core thesis?
* Have you traded around any recent spikes in VIX or oil as a hedge against a sudden escalation?

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they‚Äôd struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

Starmer said Monday that the trade agreement is ‚Äúin the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.‚Äù

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares popped nearly 10% to lead S&P 500 gainers Monday as Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target for the stock coming out of the chipmaker's ""Advancing AI"" event. 

Piper raised its target to $140 from $125 and maintained an ""overweight"" rating for AMD stock. Shares of AMD were at about $127 in recent trading, making Piper's target a roughly 10% premium. 

The analysts came away ""enthused"" by the firm's newly unveiled Helios server rack architecture, which it called ""pivotal"" for the growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Helios will combine next-generation AMD MI400 chips into one larger system, the company said, and is expected in 2026. 

AMD highlighted its partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Meta Platforms (META), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others at the event. Bank of America analysts believe there‚Äôs another high-profile partner announcement to come: Amazon (AMZN).

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was ""a key sponsor for the event,"" BofA said. However, AWS typically uses its own events to announce new engagements, making a future reveal likely, the bank added.

2025-06-16 20:18:58,reddit,Real Estate or Stocks?,"In June of last year I purchased my first house ever. I was able to put a down payment of $150k into the property, which had a cost of $350k. I now rent said property, and after mortgage and utilities, I make a monthly profit of roughly $700. 

However, I do wonder if investing the $150K in stocks might be a better option. From what I understand, the average home in the U.S. appreciates about 3‚Äì4% annually, while through the stock market, I could yield returns closer to 15%. Even if I were to invest a portion of the $700 monthly profit into stocks, the gap between the two strategies is still significant. Over a 10-year period, the difference could amount to roughly $250K.

I can‚Äôt help but wonder if selling the house is the right move, it does provide a certain sense of security. Let me know your opinions and suggestions.

2025-06-16 18:07:22,reddit,Thougts on why Cable One ($CABO) might bounce back up.,"Cable One ($CABO) caught my attention after the recent plunge to around $130,  there are several signs that this might be a solid setup for a rebound. Here is some relevant info:

*  Insider buying activity: ""Director Wallace Weitz purchased 7,000 shares of the business's stock in a transaction that occurred on Friday, June 13th. The shares were purchased at an average cost of $132.53 per share, for a total transaction of $927,710.00""

*  The stock has a P/B ratio around 0.44 and analyst recently shifted their thoughts from under perform to neutral.

* Technically oversold: RSI was far into oversold territory, resting on a key support at 52 week bottoms.

* New broadband products: Through its subsidiary Sparklight, they launched ‚ÄúFlexConnect‚Äù and ‚ÄúInternetLift‚Äù. On the other hand they extended their fiber partnerships with Nextlink, MBI and Clearwave, positively positioning CABO in the broadband market , especially in underserved areas. At the same time, they are moving away from the declining voice and video market to focus on the growing broadband industry.

* Capital allocation: The recent suspension of their quarterly cash dividend, though potentially unpopular with some investors in the short term, is a strategic move to accelerate debt repayment and invest in organic growth initiatives. This can strengthen their financial position, improve access to capital markets, and allow for more aggressive fiber build-outs

*  Finances remain healthy: Nearly $1B in dormant credit lines, manageable debt.

* B2B expansion: Residential customers are down but CABO business data segment grew +1.2% YoY.



Maybe not in the short term, but in my opinion, the stock has potential.

We also have non-retirement funds at Merril Lynch, and we had provided recent statements from them to the TIAA wealth manager so he could see our overall financial picture.

During that meeting the TIAA person said that Merril was charging us hidden SMA fees of over 2%.  He said these do not appear anywhere on any of our statements from Merill, but they were in fact being drawn out of our accounts, even during market downturns, and that they were in addition to the regular advisory fees which do appear on our statements.  He even calculated a specific percentage and specific dollar amount and said what Merril was doing was technically legal, even if it was unethical. 

Merril denies that this is the case, and frankly I believe them.  To imagine that we are being charged fees that literally appear nowhere is inconceivable to me.   But then that makes me ask why the TIAA person would even say this.  Would SMA fees generally not appear on someone's statement?  In other words, is such a situation even possible?

According to recent news, Wood added about $40 million worth of ACHR shares across three of her exchange-traded funds. The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) led the move with over 2.8 million shares, while Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) and Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX) picked up smaller amounts.


The buying spree followed Archer's announcement of an $850 million direct stock offering priced at $10 per share. Investors reacted to the dilution risk, sending shares lower.

Archer, which builds electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, has laid out bold plans to launch air taxi services ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Separately, Wood's funds cut exposure to the defense sector, selling nearly $2 million worth of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ:KTOS) stock.

The recent executive order from former President Donald Trump, aimed at fast-tracking eVTOL integration, could create tailwinds for companies like Archer.

2025-06-16 13:14:18,reddit,"WhatsApp to Show Ads, Offer Paid Subscriptions for First Time","Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. will begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service, opening a new potential revenue stream while the company invests heavily in artificial intelligence and other long-term projects. 

The ads will appear in WhatsApp‚Äôs ‚ÄúUpdates‚Äù tab, a section of the app that‚Äôs separate from a user‚Äôs inbox and private conversations. The tab gets 1.5 billion visitors per day, Meta said Monday. That tab is home to Status, WhatsApp‚Äôs version of disappearing Stories, which will now carry ads.

Advertisers can also pay to promote their WhatsApp Channel and give it prominent placement within the Updates tab. Channels allow brands or celebrities to post to a group of followers, like a giant email blast. 

As part of the advertising push, WhatsApp will also let Channel operators sell subscriptions, meaning they can create special messages just for a group of paying customers. Meta won‚Äôt take a cut of any subscriptions sold through the app at launch, but eventually plans to charge 10% of sales, Alice Newton Rex, vice president of product at WhatsApp, said in an interview. 

Meta has been spending aggressively this year on AI, including to improve the large language models that underpin generative AI features in its products. The company also just agreed to invest $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, an AI data labeling startup, according to a person familiar with the deal. The expense has added pressure on Meta‚Äôs main advertising business to continue growing to support the expanding AI effort. 

The company has spent years slowly developing a business to accompany the private messaging service acquired for $19 billion in 2014. Advertising has never been considered a great fit given the intimacy of a private messaging inbox. Meta instead built WhatsApp to cater to small businesses, including efforts to build out digital payments and shopping features. Those services have been targeted especially in countries outside the US, such as India and Brazil, where the WhatsApp is the dominant messaging app. 

While payments, in particular, has been a slow moving effort given various regulatory concerns, Meta makes billions of dollars each year selling click-to-message ads on Instagram and Facebook that send users to a WhatsApp chat conversation with the advertiser. It also allows businesses to pay to reach customers on the app who have opted to receive their direct messages. 

Part of Meta‚Äôs challenge historically has been balancing the desire to generate revenue with a desire to give WhatsApp users privacy. Meta‚Äôs other advertising products are hyper-targeted and often rely on a user‚Äôs personal information or browsing history. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, and user privacy was a major promise from co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who pledged they would never sell ads inside WhatsApp. They left Meta in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

WhatsApp ads will use broad, general targeting like a user‚Äôs location, language preferences, and Channels that they follow, Newton Rex said. Meta won‚Äôt take a person‚Äôs Facebook or Instagram information to target them with ads on WhatsApp unless they‚Äôve explicitly linked their accounts, she added. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to interrupt people‚Äôs personal messages with ads,‚Äù Newton Rex said. ‚ÄúIf you just want to carry on using WhatsApp for messaging and calling then you‚Äôll never see them at all.‚Äù

WhatsApp will begin a global rollout of ads beginning Monday, but it will take time for all users to start seeing them, she added. ",positive,0.9997746348381042,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lcshjd/whatsapp_to_show_ads_offer_paid_subscriptions_for/,WhatsApp

U.S. households to keep buying stocks this year, Goldman Sachs says

Jun 16, 2025

U.S. households are expected to remain major buyers of equities in 2025, according to a note from Goldman Sachs, which estimates they will purchase $425 billion in stocks this year, second only to corporates at $675 billion.

‚ÄúThe resilience of household demand for equities is vital,‚Äù the analysts said, noting that households ‚Äúdirectly own 38% of the U.S. equity market and control an even larger share including indirect ownership through funds.‚Äù¬†

That demand is said to have persisted even as Goldman‚Äôs Sentiment Indicator ‚Äúregisters -1.2 this week, remaining in negative territory despite a 21% rally in the S&P 500 from its April trough.‚Äù

Retail trading activity also remains robust, according to the bank.¬†

‚ÄúGoldman Sachs trading desk estimates of flows from retail trading activity suggests close to $20 billion of net buying during the past three months,‚Äù the note said.

Goldman attributes this sustained buying to a favourable macro backdrop. ‚ÄúThe typical macro drivers of equity flows suggest households will keep buying this year,‚Äù with outflows generally linked to ‚Äúweakening household balance sheets, rising unemployment, and increasing interest rates,‚Äù none of which are dominant now.

The bank added that the equity exposure of U.S. households has reached historic levels.¬†

‚ÄúHouseholds allocate 49% of their total financial assets to equities, the highest level on record,‚Äù slightly surpassing the previous peak in 2000. In contrast, households in Japan and the Euro Area allocate only 13% and 10%, respectively.

(Reuters) -Brussels negotiators hope that offering to accept U.S. tariffs of 10% across all of the European Union's exports into the United States will avert any higher duties on cars, drugs and electronics, newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Monday.

Citing high-ranking EU negotiators, the paper said the offer to U.S. counterparts would come only under certain conditions and would not be billed as permanent.

Handelsblatt also said the EU was, in return, ready to cut its tariffs on US-made vehicles, and to possibly change technical or legal hurdles to make it easier for US manufacturers to sell their cars in Europe.

The EU has also offered to completely ban purchases of Russian natural gas, potentially creating more demand for US producers.

The EU Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The EU's position comes partly from the realisation that President Donald Trump will rely on some tariff revenues to fund planned tax cuts.

US negotiators, however, have so far not agreed to limit their import duties on EU cars to 10%, the paper added.",positive,0.9999755620956421,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lcqkym/eu_prepared_to_accept_flat_10_us_tariff_with/,EU
2025-06-16 11:12:32,reddit,"Life is finite. Risk aversion. (Once bitten, Twice shy.)","Some day I will die. I do not know when, but I know I will not live forever.

Every dollar I make in salary at my workplace represents a minute, hour, day, or some other unit of time I will NEVER get back. It represents time I'm not spending with family and time I'm not out enjoying myself.

Watching that money disappear is like shaving years off my life. Hell, I'd say burning it may even be more productive since some people at least get some form of enjoyment out of smoking cigarettes...

Now obviously, I need that money to afford food and whatnot, so I can't go quitting my job. But I do not spend frivolously on luxury goods. I live in a modest house in the suburbs and drive a 20 yr old, 4 cylinder Japanese compact hatchback.

\--------------------

Late in 1999, I was given a $3k High School graduation present. Opened an eTrade account and bought a bunch tech stocks (Microsoft, Dell, IBM, Cisco, Juniper, etc) Made a couple thousand more in under a year. Figured I couldn't lose, as I had a background in tech. As an engineering student, I knew the industry. Or at least I thought I did.

By the early 2000s, my portfolio was worth three digits.

Before I pulled the plug and sold all my stocks, I was literally sitting on the computer the entirety of 2002, 2003, and 2004 hitting Refresh and watching my portfolio lose value.

I had some startup companies that were promising that ended up going under and their stock values ended up being ZERO.

I did not, and still to this day do not know where the money went. It just disappeared.

People tell me I sold in the dip when I should have bought more. I was in high school/college. I was working low end jobs and needed the money. I had no money to invest.

Few years later, I got grandmothers inheritance to the tune of $30k in 2005. Bought a house for cash in the boonies and put another $10k in my own savings into it (paint, carpet, trim work, etc.) Sold the house for $65k three months later.

Wanted a bachelor pad, so I bought another small house,  closer to where I wanted to live on an ARM in 2006 and was upside down, two years later... $240k mortgage at 5% going up to 7% in three years on a house that appraised for $125k.

BUT at least I had a roof over my head. I still own that house and it's now a rental property.

I buy houses that I can flip/rent. They're tangible and I can control what work goes into them. If I want to make a house increase in value, I can renovate it. And an house will NEVER be worth NOTHING. Even if it burns down to the ground, the vacant land will have value. Insurance also covers losses on a house. Can't insure stocks.

I am VERY risk adverse, having been bitten before.

I can not control the value of a stock. I have zero influence if a company will release a gadget that will catch on and be the next big thing or if it will flop.

I can't subtly count cards, so I don't set foot in casinos.

I'm of the mindset that to invest in stocks, you need to have money that you're not afraid of losing.

How can I get out of this mindset so that I can YOLO all my savings on whatever wallstreetbets is peddling this week? People make bank day trading.

Trump announced he'll mail formal letters to dozens of trading partners (roughly 15 key countries like Japan, South Korea, EU, Canada, Mexico) within the next week or two, demanding acceptance of new tariff terms or else face punitive tariffs

The plan builds on a universal 10% baseline tariff and steep reciprocal tariffs for specific countries

Legal backing secured - temporarily - after an appeals court ruling allow these tariffs to stay in effect for at least two more months

The regime is shifting from broad multilateral deals to one-on-one negotiations, with the EU expected to be the toughest and last to be resolved

Futures are looking surprisingly strong today, despite high geopolitical tensions and the spark reality that tariffs will not be going away any time soon. 

Expect a lot of volatility over the coming days as key economic reports are coming out and tariff news is drip fed too.

Industri Ketahanan Nasional (IKN) signed an agreement covering plans to deploy an initial fleet of Midnight aircraft in Indonesia under Archer‚Äôs Launch Edition program, valued at up to $18M (Footnote 1).

The agreement also includes the planned purchase by PT. IKN of up to 50 Midnight aircraft, valued at up to $250M(Footnote 2), for deployment in Indonesia to support plans to scale air taxi services across the country.

The companies intend to work closely with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of Indonesia (DGCA) to shape the regulatory framework to enable the Launch Edition program and then operate a safe, efficient air taxi service.
Paris, France, 16 June 2025 ‚Äì Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE: ACHR) announced today that it has signed an agreement with PT. IKN covering plans to deploy an initial fleet of Midnight aircraft in Indonesia, making it the third country in which Archer is planning to deploy Midnight under its ‚ÄúLaunch Edition‚Äù program. 

PT IKN is an Indonesian company dedicated to advancing national resilience through innovation in strategic industries, including advanced manufacturing, infrastructure and sustainable technologies through partnerships with government and industry to strengthen local capabilities and support long-term national development.

As with Archer‚Äôs other Launch Edition partners, the goal of this program is to establish a pragmatic and repeatable commercialization playbook to deploy Midnight in early adopter markets in advance of type certification in the U.S. In addition to Indonesia, Archer has already announced planned Launch Edition program deployments in the UAE, with Abu Dhabi Aviation and Ethiopia, with Ethiopian Airlines.
The program aims to establish local operational capabilities and launch commercial air taxi services in the country as soon as possible.

The scope of Archer‚Äôs planned Launch Edition program with PT. IKN includes the deployment of an initial fleet of Midnight Launch Edition aircraft to Indonesia with a supporting team of Archer pilots, technicians and engineers. Archer also plans to provide backend operational software  and front-end booking applications to help power operations during the program.  
The partners intend to collaborate closely with the DGCA to help build necessary regulatory frameworks and improve existing infrastructure to enable the Launch Edition program and subsequent safe entry into service. The Launch Edition deployment comes with plans for an aircraft order by PT. IKN of up to 50 Midnight aircraft, valued at up to $250M2, with the goal of commercializing and scaling the Indonesian market after establishing early operations. 

Yudiansah Yosal, PT IKN‚Äôs Chairman said ‚ÄúAt PT IKN we see enormous benefit in bringing new technologies to Indonesia. Deploying Archer‚Äôs Midnight aircraft, not only for passenger mobility throughout our many islands but also for environmental oversight use cases. We‚Äôre excited to bring this innovation to Indonesia and to work together with Archer to build a sustainable and scalable air mobility ecosystem.‚Äù

Major General TNI Piek Budyakto Pangdam IX / Udayana said, ‚Äú‚ÄòeVTOL aircraft like Archer's Midnight offer capabilities for both civilian and military use cases. In the civilian sector, these aircraft can potentially be used for transportation, rescue and various other purposes such as delivery of goods and air taxi transport. The partnership between Archer and PT. IKN is in line with our vision to work towards a more adaptive and modern military infrastructure that embraces innovative technologies.‚Äù

Archer Founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said, ‚ÄúThe level of demand for our ‚ÄòLaunch Edition‚Äô program continues to grow. Indonesia represents a tremendous opportunity for our Midnight aircraft both in the near and long-term, with thousands of islands, a booming tourism sector and the development of a new capital city, Ibu Kota Nusantara. We look forward to working together to demonstrate how Midnight can support missions in the country.‚Äù

1. Our agreement with this Launch Edition program partner remains conditional, subject to the execution of further definitive agreements and the satisfaction of certain conditions
 2. Aircraft orders remain conditional, subject to the execution of further definitive agreements and the satisfaction of certain conditions. Order values represent the Company‚Äôs estimate based on an indicative $5M per aircraft price.

Israeli unmanned aerial vehicles struck the South Pars gas field in southern Iran on Saturday, according to Iranian¬†state media¬†reports. The strikes hit two natural gas processing facilities, according to¬†state media. It is unclear how much damage was done to the facilities.

2025-06-16 03:21:53,reddit,$ACDC: Near-term 100 Bagger on Oil,"# TLDR: Calls on $ACDC (ProFrac). If Oil goes to $100 a barrel or higher, it will go up over 100%. I'm expecting the Oil Algos to cause a Squeeze.


(Beware this is likely regarded)

**Intro:**

I'm the one who made the discussion post about the **Strait of Hormuz**. Basically, I think the oil market is mis-pricing this **catastrophic event**. I'm sure we've all seen the headlines. JP Morgan's simulations show that oil could reach **$120-$130** a barrel. It may be unlikely, but I think the odds are **non-zero.** While it is illiquid, **Polymarket has it at a 34% chance** at the time of writing. If Israel hits **Kharg Island,** Oil will skyrocket. It's safe to say, you can't find lottery tickets with odds like that.. **If the Strait is closed, or is seriously threatened, this could be a generational play**.

Now, there are dozens of tickers that give exposure to this, but I'm a **GREEDY** fuck. Even if it's a long-shot, I want exposure to the **maximum possible lotto**. Out of all the possible tickers, **$ACDC** is my favorite. It could easily go up **200-300%** from here if Oil makes any sudden large moves..

# $ACDC: Why?

I'll keep it simple, please consult the Google charts:

https://preview.redd.it/ksp6jkzri77f1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=bebb4fc4156a1f6b4596379da269704db973c9ae

Basically, **$ACDC** is highly correlated with oil prices. Instead of wasting our time putting it in my own words, here's what **Claude** says about their business model:

https://preview.redd.it/qimrp73wi77f1.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=4403470e8248a6a167f6f0f2d1c0d0499fb4b5db

One important thing to note is the business becomes profitable at **$80** a barrel of WTI. This goes up massively at **$90, $100**, etc. That's basically the gist of it. Now for the fun part..

# Why it will Moon More Than Others:

Out of all the oil tickers, this one has the best setup for a big move. Here is the [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACDC&p=d) Data:

https://preview.redd.it/356qfcfyi77f1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb497e4ed96f143eb23add87569e52d3d4312f67

* **Insider Ownership of 93.10%**
* **Institutional Ownership of 8.45%**
* **11.06m Shares Float**
* **Short Float Interest of 36.25%**
* **Short Interest of 4.01m Shares \^**

While surveying the dozens of tickers expected to move on oil going up, this one caught my eye. This mechanical setup lends itself to explosive gains. Based on the current option prices, this is a potential **100 bagger**. The price estimations for **$ACDC** at **$120 a barrel** put it over $20 a share.

The kicker is that if Oil makes an explosive move, **Algos will buy up these stocks like crazy**. It won't hold, but I think the Algos could easily send this stock to **over $30 a share**. The buying would be extraordinary. I want to take advantage of this..

**To be clear, Reddit will not move this stock**. This is all based on the price of oil. I just think the mechanical setup provides a nice lottery ticket in case of Oil emergencies. I plan to sit back and let the algos do their thing. I just expect this stock to jump much more than others on **the day of** an oil spike.

# Positions:

**This is a small position! It's just a lottery ticket**. Depending on the situation in the Middle East, I will buy more on expiration. If the stock goes over 20, the 12c will 100x!

(Note: This is not a reddit squeeze, this just has mechanics for a massive move from Algos. It stood out to me as the best mechanics from any of the oil plays. Also, this is not financial advice and is likely quite stupid.)

2025-06-15 21:10:51,reddit,What market reaction do you expect when the economic effects of the tariffs become visible this summer?,"Looking to have a bit of discussion about everyone strategies with investments.

I've read a lot of doom and gloom posts on here about the tariffs (""*Transfer everything into cash! The US stock market will be damaged for years!*""), followed by a dip and recovery of the market to pre-tariffs days and comments from other redditors that this was always to be expected (""*Of course the market recovered, it always does! I've lived through 16 different market crashes, why would this time be any different?*""). 

And there have been a lot of discussions debating whether doom and gloom is still a valid feeling or not. I've read posts commenting that 10-20% tariffs with the US's biggest trading partners is still huge, and will have a lot of impact. Currently, the stock market seems to have stabilised and is closing in once more on all time highs.

We still haven't seen the impact of the tariffs on the various Q2 indicators both at individual company level and at national economic level, for instance inflation (later this month), GDP (expected late July), and company Q2 earnings (July-August). Not to mention of course the possibility of a recession being declared later.

What do you all expect (particular those with more years of investment experience)? Will we see the true market reaction when these come out? Do you expect a big drop, or will the market continue more or less as normal? What is your strategy (if any) to mitigate any potential risks? 

I obviously don't expect any of you to have a crystal ball, just want to hear your thoughts and opinions, and any subsequent strategies :)

2025-06-15 18:12:09,reddit,IonQ shares may plummet tomorrow,"Full disclosure: I have 6/20 puts at a 39 strike.

I‚Äôve been following this massive insider sale story very closely since I first learned about the CEO filing his Rule 105b5-1 (intent to sell) of a vast majority of his shares. 

Background on IonQ, it‚Äôs a highly speculative quantum computing company that has nearly doubled in the last 90 days after its new CEO de Masi stepped in. De Masi has spent the last 90 days going on Bloomberg and CNBC advertising the impending breakthroughs in Quantum and the future value of his company being the next NVIDIA. He must be really excited about the long-term growth of this company and be heavily vested in its future success right? WRONG.

Him and his other executives/directors just sold a MASSIVE amount of their shares on Friday after hours. Like actually sold. Not just filing a form with the SEC with the ‚Äúintent to sell. They filed Form 4s which are official sales. They collectively dumped $113M. With the CEO selling 80% of his shares. Many other executives with significant sales, some directors nearly completely cashing out. 

Ok so why is this a problem? Shouldn‚Äôt they be able to get paid? Yes and no. It‚Äôs not entirely uncommon for a CEO of a company to offload shares. Sometimes those volumes can be big. But if you‚Äôre the CEO of a $10B purely speculative tech company that is currently losing hundreds of millions a year with no foreseeable path to profitability, your ownership is key to investors conviction. If you aren‚Äôt aligned, how are we supposed to have faith in a long-term story.

He sold $103M, shouldn‚Äôt he be allowed to get rich? He‚Äôs got new incentive shares available if he hits milestones? He‚Äôs already rich‚Ä¶. he had tens of millions before cashing out. He‚Äôs not hurting in the lifestyle department. If he really thought this was the next NVIDIA as he said, his $103M could be worth billions in the future. If you already have more money than you‚Äôd ever spend, why the hell would you sell out? Because he‚Äôs calling the top, at least for now. He pumped the fuck out of the share price in his 90 days, and he knows this is the top. 

There is no good reason a company this unprofitable with tech that could be anyways from 5-20 years from being practical should be priced the way it is. Maybe there‚Äôs long term upside. If IonQ wins the quantum race. But right now it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs game. Nothing is going to happen soon.

He already won, he cashed out at recent highs. As far as I‚Äôm concerned his future incentive based shares are meaningless because whether this works or fails he just got paid $103M for 90 days of work is cashed it. If IonQ goes to zero, he still has enough more to become a billionaire investing in the markets by the time he‚Äôs 80.

Alignment is broken. If people really consider the weight of this, they will dump. But it is so hard to rationalize with IonQ bulls because they are the epitome of moonshot speculators. They will do anything to justify a gross overvaluation for a purely speculative stock bc they all think this is ‚Äútheir money ticket‚Äù. It‚Äôs not, certainly not right now. De Masi knows more than us about where this company is going in the short/medium term and he just said he doesn‚Äôt want his money along for the ride. 

If you are long IonQ, you‚Äôve got a ton of volatility headed your way and a CEO who doesn‚Äôt want his money on the table. If you‚Äôre a regard like me, there is huge opportunity in puts if morons stop artificially inflating the price.

This company should be priced for what it is, speculation. $1B market cap not $10B. $5 share price not $40-50. 

I may or may not win my bet, but holy shit this is shaping up to be one of the biggest pump and dumps I‚Äôve seen of a speculative tech company in my life.

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong¬†spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for¬†trade developments¬†as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It‚Äôs a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump‚Äôs tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after¬†May inflation data¬†came in lower than economists expected. Despite¬†comments from President Donald Trump¬†urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The¬†CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday,¬†Fed Chair Jerome Powell¬†will provide more insight into the central bank‚Äôs view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health¬†Consumer spending¬†makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday‚Äôs housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a¬†need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as¬†early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on¬†artificial intelligence (AI)¬†and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is¬†well-positioned to lead the market¬†in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar‚Äôs (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's¬†warning of weakness¬†in the housing market in the prior quarter.¬† The scheduled Friday reports from¬†accounting firm Accenture¬†(ACN) and¬†online car seller CarMax¬†(KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.

2025-06-15 07:26:21,reddit,The question that is always on my mind.,"I‚Äôm 37, and I keep on doing a ton of mathematical gymnastics with all the different dividends yields, and it always comes back to the same thing: if you got 20 to 30 years in the market, then just go VOO all the way through the ups and the downs. You‚Äôll come out ahead in total market value (with dividends reinvested) almost every time compared to 99% of other dividend ETF combinations.

THEN you can play the dividend game 20-30 years later when you‚Äôve amassed a nice chunk of value from all that market appreciation growth with VOO. Yes, you‚Äôd have to sell your asset to then buy a new one(s) that generates you income. But doing exactly that, compared to having a strictly income oriented dividend portfolio for 20-30 years (with all dividends reinvested), will give you MORE monthly income because the value of your dividend giving equity is now far greater due to your sale of a different equity that grew much quicker. For example: it‚Äôs better to buy VOO for 30 years, then sell it and buy SCHD to live off dividends. Compared to JUST buying (and using DRIP) on SCHD for 30 years and then live of its dividends.

Right?

I know this question gets asked a lot and this topic is always brought up but I kinda want a clear answer on it: if I don‚Äôt care about the dividends until my year based goal - then should I just absolutely forget about dividends and yields and CAGR and all that jazz for the next next couple of decades and come back to it later once I‚Äôve amassed wealth in VOO ( or even a more growth oriented ETF like SCHG or QQQM)?",positive,0.9999492168426514,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lbui5d/the_question_that_is_always_on_my_mind/,
2025-06-15 00:52:33,reddit,Thinking about my future instead of sleeping,"Hi everyone,

I'm 19 and currently attending university, next year instead of moving straight into third year, I have the opportunity to do something called a placement year with a company of my choice.

For those of you eho don't know what a placement year is, it is a full/most of a year where you gain real world experience within a company that you apply for, just like a normal job. The great thing is you get experience and develop skills in your chosen industry whilst also getting paid a decent salary of around ¬£25,000 annually (As you can tell by the pound symbol I live in the UK).

I am pretty much set on doing a placement year and plan to save most of my money that I earn from this in my long term investment portfolio. 

I have two roads that I can choose from.

My question that I would love for you guys to help me with is if I should use those savings to pay off my third year of Univeristy. Unfortunately in the UK, an undergraduate degree is not free and I have already taken loans for my first and second years at ¬£9,250 per year. By paying of my third year from my own pocket (savings), I essentially have less debt and will also not suffer from the ludicrous interest in a loan at least for that year. 

My other option instead is to use that money and to save it all into my long term portfolio where in especially a few decades down the line I would have profitted immensely from starting at what I hope is a young age. 

Thank you so much for whoever has read this far and your help would be greatly appreciated :)).",positive,0.9991926550865173,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lbntmp/thinking_about_my_future_instead_of_sleeping/,
