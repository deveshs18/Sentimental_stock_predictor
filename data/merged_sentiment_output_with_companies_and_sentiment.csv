I highly recommend you read the original Sana guy post but here is my **TLDR** of why I'm excited:

1. 9.5 million ppl worldwide have type 1 diabetes
2. they need to take insulin regularly which **costs** them **$20,000 yearly** (source: [https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2020.26.3.311](https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2020.26.3.311), 2020 average)
3. Sana is gene-editing cells that produce insulin and transplanting them in the patient's body effectively curing them (using hypoimmune tech to avoid rejection)
4. if Sana captures 10% of the market (**950,000 patients**) at **$150,000 per cure**, that’s **$142.5B total revenue**
5. over 10 years, that’s **$14.25B/year** with potential **$10B/year profit** at 70% margins
6. current **$950M market cap** is undervalued, suggesting significant upside if trials succeed
7. price target of **$9–$10** by analysts (see https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-is-the-sana-stock-price-t-NIpiTMTLQHqct1WARt3UOw)
8. Low sample size in trial concern: The mechanism is fundamental/universal. Sana removes two immune markers (MHC I and II — proteins found on all human cells that signal ‘foreign’ to the immune system) and adds a “don’t attack me” signal (CD47), allowing their cells to evade immune detection. Because these immune markers are present in everyone, the approach is designed to work across all patients.",positive,0.9999920129776001,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1m080hp/sana_40k_yolo_up_23_in_3_weeks_thank_you_sana_guy/,

So I was looking to start building a dividend position in el, but after its recent spike, I’m a bit hesitant. Right now I believe el is fair value, especially when looking at their p/fcf with the past 5 years. I’m thinking maybe building a position in target instead. Cause sure the upside might not be as much in terms of share price, but a pe of 11, ps of 0.45 and p/fcf of 13 when the 5 year average for them are pe: 18, ps: 0.76, p/fcf: 29. It looks undervalued. The issue though with target is they are having trouble with foot traffic, and declining sales as well as same store sales. Their target circle membership and curbside service seem to be doing good(25% growth last time I checked) so I do think they can still turn it around. Dis is another option but it’s the last of the three, I still think el might be the move but I’m not sure cause of the recent price surge. What do y’all think?

2025-07-15 01:00:00,reddit,RVHP.  This biotech company has high potential to make us rich!!,"
Company Overview

Reviva Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: RVPH) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for central nervous system (CNS), respiratory, inflammatory, and cardiometabolic diseases. Its lead candidate, Brilaroxazine (RP5063), targets schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, with promising Phase 3 results and an NDA filing expected in Q3 2025 A B.

Investment Thesis: Why RVPH Is a Strong Buy

1. Promising Drug Pipeline

• Brilaroxazine has demonstrated robust efficacy across multiple symptom domains in schizophrenia, including negative symptoms, with low adverse event rates B.
• Additional indications under development include bipolar disorder, depression, ADHD, Alzheimer’s psychosis, pulmonary hypertension, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis A.
• The company is also advancing RP1208 for depression and obesity.


2. Analyst Ratings & Price Targets

Metric	Value	
Consensus Rating	Strong Buy C D	
Average Price Target	$9.00 (+2200% upside) C D	
High Target	$17.00	
Low Target	$3.00	
Analyst Coverage	5 analysts, all bullish D	


Brokerages like D. Boral Capital and HC Wainwright have consistently maintained buy ratings, citing undervaluation and strong clinical data D E.

3. Undervalued Market Cap

• Current Market Cap: ~$18.8M F
• Book Value per Share: $0.02 F
• Price-to-Book Ratio: 19.6 (suggests overvaluation on assets, but justified by pipeline potential) F
• Cash Position: ~$5.3M as of Q2 2025 G


Despite a steep drop in share price (down ~78% YTD), the valuation does not reflect the upside from Brilaroxazine’s NDA and potential commercialization.

4. Insider & Institutional Confidence

• Insider Ownership: 27.18% F
• Institutional Ownership: 63.18% F


High insider and institutional ownership signals strong internal and market confidence in the company’s trajectory.

5. SEC Filings & Financial Discipline

• Recent 10-Q (May 2025) and 10-K (April 2025) filings show disciplined R&D spending and strategic capital raises to support clinical milestones H I.
• The company completed a $10M public offering in June 2025 to fund operations and regulatory submissions B.

Risks & Considerations

• Cash Burn: Negative free cash flow of ~$18.5M TTM G.
• Regulatory Risk: Approval of Brilaroxazine is not guaranteed.
• Dilution: Frequent public offerings may dilute shareholder value.
• Short Interest: ~10% of float sold short, indicating bearish sentiment F.

Strategic Catalysts

• Q3 2025: NDA filing for Brilaroxazine in schizophrenia.
• Q4 2025: Potential FDA feedback and partnership announcements.
• 2026+: Expansion into respiratory and metabolic indications.

Conclusion

RVPH presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for investors seeking exposure to biotech innovation. With a strong clinical pipeline, bullish analyst sentiment, and significant upside potential, RVPH is positioned as a speculative but compelling buy for those with a tolerance for volatility and a long-term profit!",neutral,0.9999953508377075,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1m044z8/rvhp_this_biotech_company_has_high_potential_to/,RVHP

My intended strategy is approximately 38/58/4, 38% in S&P 500 etfs 58% in international etfs and 4% in bonds. So far my biggest single position is IVV at 20% of my account.

My question is how do I reinvest within those brackets? I heard to invest a set percent of each new dollar into each etf/stock and never deviate but I'm not sure if that’s best. 

My current strategy is investing in winners proportionally and selling losers as they manifest. It basically means I sort my portfolio by current value and add new funds to make my cost basis also in the same order. If an etf is too far out of line by being an underperformer I usually cut some of it to make it match but I'm much more eager to just invest in etfs that are a lower cost basis rather than sell underperforming assets. Once that’s done I invest a set percent into each etf. This strategy is definitely winner and time biased. 

I’m trying to avoid “cutting the flowers and watering the weeds” so to speak and letting winners grow quickly and losers get neglected. 

So is this a good or bad strategy? What strategy should i do instead?",positive,0.9967585206031799,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1m0262e/what_is_a_good_rebalancing_strategy_and_what/,

Aside from the pension investments, I have a managed 401k, which isn't doing much, and I have a Roth IRA and an account that I manage, which was initially part of my 401k (this is an option without penalty). I thought that in doing this, I would have more flexibility with my investments. 

The problem is, I am LOST on what to invest in. My choices have not been the best, and I have lost some money.

I'm hoping to gain some insight. Some know-how. How can I be a better investor and make better choices? Are there any recommended reading materials that can point me in the right direction, as they have worked for other successful investors? Additionally, is there any news/data source I should follow to stay updated and stay ahead of the game?  

Again, I'm in my 40s. I have a solid 20 years left before I retire. It would be nice to retire sooner, but because I wasted time fiddling with what hasn't worked, I think 20 years is where it's at.

Servicenow is around 20% down from its ATH, had a bigger drawdown around April but I missed this opportunity. Right now, it's one of the few tech stocks that are big but not one of the FAANG companies that are not on ATH.

Copart is around 28% down from its ATH, with the lowest stock price since January 2024. The stock is in a very long-term upward trend, it could drop below 200 EMA soon for the first time in ages though soon.

Berkshire is around 12% down from its ATH. It's a stock that you never get cheap, the last time it had such a drawdown was in 2023. Buffett retiring concerns me a bit though, it was inevitable considering his age, but he practically was Berkshire and his departure could take away from the ""myth"" BRK.

2025-07-14 17:52:24,reddit,$MEOH (Methanex): Why no love?,"Let me disclose upfront:

* I've held MEOH for 10+ years
* My avg cost is low $20s.
* I’m not trying to offload shares, I’m holding and might add.
* I'm posting here to get thoughts, build awareness (of course it helps boost my port value), and understand why it gets little or no attention.

# What is Methanex?

* World's largest methanol producer.
* Converts natural gas into methanol and ships it globally.
* Stable, profitable commodity business
* Canadian (based on Vancouver, BC)
* I can hear the yawns already

# OCI Acquisition

* \~$1.2B in cash
* \~9.9 million new MEOH shares (about 15% dilution)
* \~$450M in assumed debt/leases

Assets acquired:

* Two ""world-scale"" methanol plants in Beaumont, Texas
   * Includes OCI Beaumont and a 50% stake in Natgasoline (largest U.S. methanol plant)
   * One plant also produces ammonia
* A global low-carbon methanol production and marketing business (OCI HyFuels)
* An idled plant in the Netherlands (Delfzijl)

Why the idled plant?  
Delfzijl gives Methanex a pre-built, permitted foothold in Europe. It’s currently offline but useful for future growth or clean fuel mandates. In short, it gives them optionality, not immediate contribution.

# Stock Reaction

* Stock dropped \~25% since just before the OCI deal was announced on 9/8/24.
* $33.58 as I write this on 7/14/25
* CEO bought 2,958 shares (\~$150K) in mid-June at \~$37.50.
* BMO set a $65 target (>90% upside).

# Valuation Snapshot

* Trailing EPS (Q1 2025): about $3.29
* P/E ratio: about 10 to 11 times
* Forward P/E: about 13 times consensus
* Reasonable for a profitable, now larger, industrial business

# How much capacity did OCI add?

* Methanex now reports 10.4 million tonnes per year (mtpa) total operating capacity.
* OCI assets added about 2.6 mtpa active capacity, with optional upside from Delfzijl (about 1 mtpa idle).
* That's a \~44% increase in total potential capacity.

# EPS Upside Estimate

* If OCI is successfully integrated and margins hold:
   * EPS could rise from \~$3.30 to $4.50
* At that level, the forward P/E at today’s price ($34) would drop to \~7.5 to 8 times

# Future Stock Price Scenarios

|EPS|8× P/E|10× P/E|12× P/E|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$4.30|$34.40|$43.00|$51.60|
|$4.60|$36.80|$46.00|$55.20|

* Base case: $46 to 55 (if integration succeeds and valuation normalizes)
* Upside case: $60 or more (if methanol market strengthens or Europe ramps clean fuels)
* Downside case: Flat if OCI adds little and macro weakens

# What’s coming next?

Q2 Earnings on 7/30

* OCI deal closed 7/27, so only 3 days included in Q2
* Expect:
   * Confirmation of close
   * One-time charges
   * Management commentary
* Don’t expect:
   * Full OCI financials
   * Revised guidance (likely Q3)

Real impact shows up in Q3 (Oct/Nov) once OCI results are fully consolidated.

# Insider Buying History

|Date|Price|6‑Mo Ret|12‑Mo Ret|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mar 2020|$22.00|\+48%|\+120%|COVID recovery|
|Nov 2016|$35.00|\+15%|\+40%|Methanol supercycle|
|Aug 2014|$60.00|–20%|–35%|Oil crash|
|May 2012|$30.00|\+5%|\+25%|Steady growth|
|Jun 2025|$37.50|TBD|TBD|Post-OCI, stock now $33.40|

# Expected reader pushback:

* “Analyst targets are BS”: fair
* “Insider buys are small"": fair
* “You’re betting on OCI and methanol demand"": fair
* Canadian stock, so US investors get hit with foreign taw withdrawal on dividends
* Commodity stocks are volatile
* MEOH has little options interest and therefore lacks leverage/excitement, comparatively speaking

Here’s why I’m holding:

* I have a good cost basis.
* The capacity added by the acquisition of OCI is real, running and producing.
* EPS could rise 30 to 40 percent over time
* Forward P/E could drop to about 7.5 to 8 times
* Methanex has stayed profitable through multiple cycles.
* Balance sheet still manageable after the deal

#  Risks

* OCI integration underperforms
* Methanol demand weakens
* Trump tariff wars, macro instability (e.g. Chinese demand)
* Dilution doesn’t get offset by future earnings

#  Bottom Line

This isn’t a meme stock or a fast mover. It is a scaled-up, globally positioned chemical producer trading at about 10 to 11 times earnings now, possibly less than 8 times forward, with clear upside if execution goes right.

That's a lot of ""ifs,"" ""coulds,"" etc.

Still, I’m watching Q3. I’ll likely buy if it dips under $30.   
  
In the mean time, I'm wondering: Why no discussion for MEOH?

2025-07-14 16:52:06,reddit,Opendoor Discovers For Sale Signs,"Following up on my last Opendoor post. Rally started after June 27 like we called it. I doubled down and made $100k last week:

https://preview.redd.it/5mhcs5padvcf1.png?width=1999&format=png&auto=webp&s=c823e5e63e9912cee180b461e5a07abf6adbcbb4

Not selling when we could still pull a Carvana and 100x:

https://preview.redd.it/t31j0wg0kwcf1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7ff38ed6286883cd390054faa3c5ed772ff3896

**Tl;dr:** Opendoor is a tech company that’s been figuring out real estate. They’ve been trying real hard to disrupt everything, so hard they didn’t do basic real estate stuff like for sale signs or guided tours. They’ve learned these things now, so stock go up. 

**Opendoor is the next Carvana**

The Carvana parallels are obvious: 

\-Convenience buyers that offer low but reasonable prices

\-Add profit by bundling services

\-Grew too fast before they figured out their operations

\-Got crushed when rates rose

\-Scaled back to fix their operations

\-Comparably sized, both doing about $15B revenue at their peak

The differences are, well, first Carvana cooks their books. But also Opendoor had more operational problems to fix. They didn’t always use for sale signs. It takes real creativity to innovate that badly.

2025 is the year they finally fix their operations. Margins are going up. Holding times are going way down, and with that less risk of being blown up in a housing crash. They’re getting free referral revenue, the core of Zillow and Redfin’s business. 

There’s also coming tailwinds from lowering interest rates. That will make house prices more affordable, lower Opendoor’s interest costs, shorten holding times and reduce risk from falling home prices. 

As margins go up and risk goes down, Opendoor can start offering better deals to customers.  Zillow gives an Opendoor offer to virtually every home seller in the country:

https://preview.redd.it/kfka02zedvcf1.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=89ef80acaa997071293032939ccd2e0f9d149e5b

It’s a crazy good marketing funnel. They can multiply their revenue at any time by simply offering better deals to customers. 

Opendoor’s price/sales is an incredibly low 0.1, compared to Carvana’s 5.0 and Palantir’s 100. The market hates this stock. If they start growing and making profit, they could earn a price/sales of 2.5 (half Carvana’s), a 25x stock return. If revenue returns to 2022 levels, that’s another 3x from current levels, for a total 75x return.

**Opendoor Discovers for Sale Signs**

As we all know, realtors are only good for three things. They can put up for sale signs. They stage houses with furniture. They walk gracefully through houses opening doors for buyers. 

Well, turns out, Opendoor didn’t know how to do those things. They used to put up for-sale signs, but squatters learned an Opendoor sign means the house is unoccupied, so now in some cities they don’t. So in those cities buyers don’t even know the house is for sale. They have to rely on real estate agents to bring customers to the house, and many real estate agents see Opendoor as a threat and blacklist their houses. So that’s a problem.

Opendoor also [doesn’t do home tours](https://www.facebook.com/reel/749560697395642). They expect customers to know a house without a sign is listed, then download their app. The app unlocks the door and lets the buyer do a self-tour of an often musty, unstaged home, with nobody to ask questions to. Do you know who has money to buy homes right now? Boomers. Boomers don’t use apps. 

So yeah, lots of creative self-sabotage going on here by Opendoor. This quarter they [fired or reassigned](https://web.archive.org/web/20250613164011/https://www.housingwire.com/articles/opendoor-lays-off-40-more-workers-amid-ongoing-struggles/) 110 internal sales people, who were not putting up for sale signs, putting furniture in houses, or opening doors. Now they’re recruiting local real estate agents, who presumably understand these things: 

https://preview.redd.it/rdwudh7hdvcf1.png?width=317&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6ac92940226f1e3ad90e588f6442a1ec17068c0

So yeah they’re working with real estate agents now, which means Opendoor will start doing the bare minimum like for sale signs, staging and home tours. As a side bonus they have to pay 110 fewer salaries, which should more than cover the cost of paying the agents. Stock go up. 

**Real Estate Agents to Pay Opendoor**

They’re also using real estate agents to acquire the homes. But basically, customers don’t really know what their house is worth and they don’t trust Opendoor sales reps. So Opendoor sends their customers to local real estate agents now, who explain that Opendoor is the quick and convenient way to sell but they’ll get more money listing normally. If the customer wants to sell traditionally, the agent pays Opendoor a commission. If they sell to Opendoor, Opendoor uses the agent for a home inspection before buying. 

It’s kind of brilliant actually. Customer referral is where the money is made in real estate. Real estate agents will forgo half their commission for a new customer referral. It’s how Zillow and Redfin make money. So this is a big change, it could be a free $100M-$200M a year Opendoor was leaving on the table.

So Opendoor is getting free revenue. They don’t have to hire a huge sales team and home inspection team anymore. And they’re fixing their customer trust problem by sending customers to agents and giving them an honest breakdown of their options. It’s a way better plan. 

**Opendoor is a real business, I promise**

Selling a house sucks. You have to keep your house clean and cook appetizers for strangers for 3-6 months. Buyers haggle on repairs, sometimes back out on deals. It’s miserable, puts your life on hold, and when you finally sell you pay 6% of the home value to realtors and fees on top.

It sucks. A lot of people would pay $20k+ to skip it. This is especially true for people that need to move quickly, perhaps because they got a new job or got divorced. Opendoor provides a low but reasonable offer and pays cash within a few days. They also make money by adding title and escrow services on top. This last quarter they also started collecting referral fees from customers that approach them but decide not to sell. 

Opendoor is a tech company. They've had a team of data scientists building home pricing models in San Francisco for a decade now. The models let them estimate their profit margin, and every time they sell a house they collect more data and improve their algorithms.

**Q2 Data**

Everything is meeting guidance for Q2 (Source: Datadoor):

https://preview.redd.it/c3u1i7hidvcf1.png?width=1999&format=png&auto=webp&s=df6062e06a12866df51b7fe9b4e5cc84c2bdff68

Sales are dropping in June, but that’s expected because they’re reducing acquisitions at the peak of the seasonal housing market. Their unsold homes are listed with very healthy margins:

https://preview.redd.it/tdl864gkdvcf1.png?width=1212&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac87a13c9476be2ce27fddfca77116bd0ea379e6

Even if house prices drop this Fall, with those margins Opendoor will make a nice profit. 

Acquisitions are cratering. Remember how I said they’ve been lighting money on fire every year by buying houses in the Summer? They finally stopped doing that, as expected:

https://preview.redd.it/3m8v8mtkhvcf1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=e09baf4ecbf8a9e9bb468159b4c386f58d29c8bb

Sure, not exciting to see acquisitions go down. But in the past they’ve always lost money with their Summer acquisitions. They’ve blown tens of millions in marketing just to buy houses at the peak of the seasonal market. Then they’ve had to pay holding and interest costs to place them on the market and drop their price every month until they finally sell in the Spring. 

This time, they’re sending most of their Summer customers to local real estate agents and collecting a risk-free referral commission. On the few homes they are buying, they’re charging a premium and will make a handsome profit on that inventory. Plus, they won’t be paying interest to own billions of dollars in homes that go down in value during Fall and Winter months. 

Imo that means we’re going to see way better profit numbers in Q3 and Q4 despite the drop in revenue. In Q4 guidance is for ramping up marketing to acquire more houses. I’m looking for acquisitions to pick up in Q4. Q1 and Q2 2026 should be amazing quarters, since they won’t be dragged down by 9-month old inventory acquired the previous Summer. 

These numbers are why I’m expecting Opendoor’s stock to rise to the $3-$5 “not dead yet” range this year, and then blow up next Summer. Revenue should go down this Fall and Winter while losses are cut. Next Summer is when we see revenue rise alongside profit margin.

**Bear Case**

Food for thought. I think the risk/reward for this stock is a great deal right now but there’s absolutely risk too.

This is a company with a long history of losing money. Most people haven’t heard of it. Those that do either hear they offer terrible deals (currently true!) or are incompetent (also true). 

Carvana’s main profit source is predatory car loans. This gives it way better margins than Opendoor ever will.

Carvana’s brand is way better than Opendoor’s. Carvana has superbowl ads and giant car vending machines you can see from the interstate. Opendoor has years of Reddit posts of real estate agents shitting on them.

Scaling back purchases in the Summer is just another step towards shrinking revenue and relevance. 

How are they supposed to offer good deals to customers when they have to pay Zillow a referral fee, plus pay real estate agents to help buy and sell the house? 

Finally, weren’t they supposed to disrupt the housing market and get rid of realtors? Now their game plan is to work with them?

**Things that would make me sell**

I am not a permabull on this stock. If they fail to deliver I’m out. What I’m watching for:

\-Real results from the new agent program

\-Narrowed losses in Q3 and Q4

\-Acquisition growth in Q4

**Chance of Acquisition**

If Opendoor fails, there’s a reasonable chance it could be bought for > $0.50/share. I’ve talked to two people that work in institutional real estate that tell me it would be an attractive purchase to Rocket Mortgage, Zillow, or a REIT. The company has billions in homes, a nice pricing algorithm backed by a decade of data, the Zillow partnership, brokerage licenses in almost every state, relationships with real estate agents, home builders and repair contractors across the country. Plus, Opendoor has $600M+ in cash and homes that are worth more than the debt used to buy them. Reasonable chance of getting some money back if this bet fails.

**Reverse Split**

Opendoor announced a vote for a reverse split which got a lot of people worried. A lot of penny stocks are zombies, out of cash, that fund operations by diluting the stock, reverse splitting, then diluting again. They basically survive by robbing shareholders of their equity. That’s not what’s going on here, Opendoor still has about $600M cash left, they aren’t diluting shares to survive. Total shares are only growing at 5-6% a year:

https://preview.redd.it/w6sjkx43uvcf1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8ed17421d196b90db3ba7d154ba3c49a480899c

There’s no reverse split yet. They will only have to reverse split if the stock trades below $1 by the end of November, otherwise Nasdaq will delist it. The way the company is improving I think we’ll be way above $1 by then.

Even if they have to reverse split I’m not worried. Share count drops 10x but so does overall share count, so company ownership percent stays the same. It would be embarrassing for the company, but that’s all it means.

**Valuation**

Opendoor’s stock price, interpreted:

<$1: flaming trash. Price/sales of 0.1. Below liquidation value. Market thinks the company is doomed with no acquisition potential.

$1-$3: Trash, but not bankrupt for a while.

$3-$7: Shiny trash with turnaround potential

$7-$15: Cute small business. Niche profitable company that isn’t growing.

$50+: Carvana status. Profitable company with growing margins, revenue and brand awareness. Could happen if they return to 2022’s $16B scale, but with profit.

Based on the information we currently have, I think this stock is good value below $5. There’s still potential for a 10x at $5, but given the company’s history it ought to trade at a discount until they prove they can deliver.

**Conclusion**

Stocks go up when they beat market expectations. Expectations couldn’t be lower for Opendoor. The previous business plan was to waste marketing dollars buying overpriced houses in the Summer, pay interest while the houses depreciate all Fall and Winter, then resell 9 months later at a tiny profit.

2025-07-14 15:05:41,reddit,AI is overvalued,"I am going to preface this with the fact I have worked in the AI field with some big companies for about 10 years now and understand everything about AI and how it works. 

I think a AI bubble is here, we are overvalueing every company that seems to use AI for the sole reason that it uses AI. We are creating a bubble of artificial valuation. AI has many uses and I do believe we will continue using it in the future, but that does not mean it is now the most powerful market indicator. The value of AI companies should be based on the integration value. Why does every AI company hit huge numbers shortly after the launch. It makes no sense. The whole point of valuation is how much shareholder value can they provide and with many of these new companies that number is real low. We are throwing money at these useless AI companies for absolutely no reason. We can look at a example of OpenAI. They are at the cutting edge of LLM  technology. It is never going to become the next ""Google"" and while I do think it is amazing what they do and I use Chatgpt often, why does everyone say they are undervalued. It isn't a trillion dollar company. That is just one dumb example though. The real overvaluation is the 75% of AI companies that are truly useless. We will always use AI in the future as a society, but it won't be a million companies, it will be the best of the best that we use for everything. 

There are countless AI companies that all think because they use AI they are the future, and we do fall for it. I think that in the near future there will be a AI burst. The bubble will finally collapse, it will hit everyone harder than we would ever expect. I have no idea when its going to happen, could be this year, could be next, and could be in 5 years. The overvaluation of AI is at least 50% artificial. 

Shorting AI might sound stupid, and it could be I am totally wrong, but what if I am right. 

Edit: I am not talking about the big hitters in the AI industry. The OpenAI, Palantir, Nvidia are all huge and extremely impactful. I am solely saying these are the companies that will survive. They are so ahead of everyone else that in 1 day they can teach a model to do virtually anything. Other companies will be forced to die out. This is just my prediction for the future of AI.

The way I trade.. and I'm way up overall paying my bills and only day trading for money.. is to focus on the top performing stock of the day and if it's starts rising I buy it and let it go up.. and as soon as it comes down the idea is to sell it.  A lot of the time a stock will be dramatically going up when I buy then dramatically fall in the span of 30 seconds.

If I input a ""stop sell order"", I have to cancel it before I can sell.   And sometimes I get greedy and don't hold to my own standards which causes me to lose thousands in seconds.. instead of a 200$ loss which would be fine.  

I've made tens of thousands of dollars but it should be more like hundreds at this point.. my losses are killing my gains as is the ebb and flow of trading.

2025-07-14 14:26:54,reddit,The future of film. Netflix or some other company?,"Netflix has announced that they will begin showing AI generated ads in 2026. It's pretty clear what happens from there. What starts as 15-30 second AI-generated advertisements shown in the middle of your favorite TV series eventually evolves into 40-50 minute AI-generated episodes that *become* your new favorite TV series.

At some point in the not too distant future, and perhaps sooner than you think, the major streaming platforms will start rolling out feature-length films and TV series created entirely with AI. Over time, the quality will improve to be indistinguishable from real life.

The future of film is not in big budget productions with a cast of A-list stars. The future of film is in AI-generated content, created for pennies on the dollar and with very few human actors. Movies and series will be produced not over several months or years on set at some studio in Hollywood but in a few days or hours from who knows where. Like Bibles with the introduction of the printing press, they'll be produced in the thousands.

And companies can limit their exposure to risk by shifting to an On Demand model. Sure, there will be established franchises like Marvel and Star Wars and others they'll keep dishing out, but long gone will be the days when a studio drops $150M on a movie that flops.

Because the future of film won't be just Netflix Original content (or another company's), much of it will be *your* content. You'll have the power of Gen AI at your fingertips.

It won't be long until you can log into Netflix or another platform, and with a simple prompt or a choice of a few options, generate an entire film or TV series that you can watch that day and share with your friends. User content will be circulated and rated like your aunt's potato salad recipe on Allrecipes.com.

Movies are inherently procedural. Every story, at least a decent one, has:

* Structure (Freytag's pyramid, Three-act Play, The Hero's Journey, etc)
* Plot (Rags to Riches, Overcoming the Monster, Comedy, Tragedy, and Rebirth, etc)
* Theme (Love, Good vs Evil, Coming of Age, etc)
* Tone (Serious, Uplifting, Bleak, etc)
* Conflict (Man vs Man, Man vs Society, Man vs Nature, etc)
* Characters (Humans, Elves, Demons, Robots, Zombies, etc)
* Setting (Present Day, Apocalyptic, Alternate Dimension, Mars, etc)

You'll be able mix and match all of these elements and generate a prompt. BOOM - you have a new film or TV series that you'll be the first to view. Give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and Netflix will learn from your prompt and produce better recipes tailored just for you. You'll be able to share it with your friends on Netflix too. Top rated user content will be owned by Netflix who can sell it or rent it. Maybe they'll give you a percentage of the profit.

If you want a franchise with 20 movies, you'll have it. If you want TV series with 50 seasons, you'll have it.

So, what could the future look like?

Netflix has a current market cap of $529B with subscriptions priced between $7.99 and $24.99/mo. It's not unrealistic to double, triple, or even quadruple these costs to provide what I just described. As a millennial, I remember paying $70ish for cable 10-15 years ago. You have to believe people will be willing to pay a similar cost for On Demand film.

Is it unrealistic to forecast Netflix with a market cap of $2T?

Perhaps it's Google (Alphabet), not Netflix who will capitalize on this - and they won't just stick to movies and series. They'll evolve YouTube into a Generative AI hub. Create film, series, vlogs, and more. Veo3 is impressive. How much more capable will it be in 10 years?

If Nvidia is building ""AI factories"" to produce off-the-shelf AI models, then on-demand AI film is not so far fetched.

2025-07-14 13:53:10,reddit,EU issues tough warning of countermeasures if US-EU trade talks break down - will markets falter?,"Background Sorting: 

Trade tensions between the US and Europe have heated up again over the past two weeks. Despite the departure of the Biden administration, Trump reinstated some of the tariffs on Europe prior to his campaign, particularly related to automobiles, precision manufacturing equipment and green energy products.

Today, EU Vice-President Sefcovic made it clear that if negotiations fail, the EU will not hesitate to take reciprocal countermeasures, including imposing tariffs or limits on U.S. high-tech products, cloud services and chip equipment.

Short-term market judgment: 

If the US-EU talks continue to stall, it will weigh on large-cap tech stocks in the short- to medium-term, especially for companies with high international revenue share (e.g., NVDA, AAPL, AMD).

However, if positive signals of progress in negotiations can be released later this week, the market will repair quickly.

The current rise in volatility expectations for August in the options market suggests that institutions are already hedging their bets against conflicting risks.

My strategy (not a recommendation): 

Lightly hold tech ETFs (e.g. QQQ) and closely monitor the EU response meeting on 7/16 

If conflict escalates, plan to buy short-term defensive ETFs (e.g. XLU / SH) if the VIX breaks 15+ 

Watch for shifts in international stances during the Biden and Trump campaigns, as the policy set-ups will influence the direction of capital allocation in Sept.

What do our Reddit friends think?

2025-07-14 13:52:50,reddit,My most successful trade: A TSLA option that turned $10k into $210k  what I learned,"One of my most successful trades was buying calls on Tesla (TSLA) this year, which ended up returning more than 20x, with \~$10,000 in royalties turning into nearly $210,000.

Setup:

I've been tracking TSLA for a while now. This setup is based on a combination of fundamental beliefs and technical signals:

MACRO BACKGROUND: The electric vehicle industry is gaining momentum and retailer interest is strong.

COMPANY NEWS: TSLA just reported strong earnings growth and potential inclusion in the S&P 500.

TECHNICAL BREAKOUT: It broke through a key resistance level near $500 on heavy volume.

OPTION ACTIVITY: Unusual volume in the OTM strike calls, suggesting a possible call.

I bought a small OTM call 4-6 weeks out with the goal of continuing the breakout. Instead of targeting 20x, I expected maybe double or triple, but TSLA went parabolic.

Result:

Within a couple weeks, the stock rallied sharply and IV widened. I sold near the local top for a $210,000 return.

Was it luck or skill?

Both:

analysis put me in the right position.

Timing and excess returns? It was definitely a stroke of luck; I couldn't have predicted the size of the move.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Beliefs are important, but trade sizes need to be appropriate.

Options are powerful tools that can work both ways.

Scaling back is often wiser than operating blindly.

The hype may be further out than you expect, and the momentum is real.

Tesla (TSLA) up over 1% 

Boeing (BA) also up about 1% 

Cryptocurrency Concepts Are Taking Off 

Azure (NIO) surges about 5% as new energy vehicles heat up again 

Meanwhile, Trump is on Truth Social again: the Nasdaq, tech, industrials - all at record highs. Cryptocurrencies are going crazy. The Fed should cut rates immediately. Inflation? Doesn't exist!

Three major thrusts behind today's market rally:

Positive macro data 

CPI inflation data released last week came in at 3.2% (y/y), which was lower than market expectations 

Markets are starting to bet that the Fed may cut rates sooner 

US bond yields have come down (10-year Treasuries are currently around 3.84%) 

Trump's statements have heated up expectations 

He has publicly called for an “immediate cut in interest rates” 

said. “He's the reason the market is at record highs” 

Whether you agree or not, the market loves any dovish (rate cut) signal, even if it's a political shout 

Hot Sectors Rotate 

Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin back above $83,000, Ether follows 

→ COIN, MSTR, MARA and other related stocks all in the red pre-market 

New Energy Vehicles. NIO leads the way, TSLA steady - may be related to China stimulus and rumors of lower battery costs 

INDUSTRY & AEROSPACE: Boeing shines as it benefits from defense export expectations and capital rotation

Three things I'm watching this week:

Earnings season is here: tech giants start announcing earnings this week, will it continue to push the market higher or be a head-scratcher?

Fed officials statement: will they make a hawkish counterattack to the “Trump-style rate cut shouts”?

Sector rotation risk: will AI, tech stocks top out? Is money flowing into crypto, industrials, energy?

What do you think:

Will you get on board with this Trump wave? Or are you ready to reverse course?

NIO Is it for real this time or just another high and low?

Does anyone else feel like this scenario resembles the eve of that early 2020's bull market?",neutral,0.7025787830352783,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lzmave/stocks_rise_trump_speaks_out_cryptocurrencies/,

2025-07-14 12:40:14,reddit,Question about 401K fund.,"I am contributing 9% to my 401k.  My employer contributes yearly which ends up being about 4.5% whether I contribute or not.  The funds aren't very good in my opinion.  I was in a portfolio that the company managing the 401k deemed ""moderate/aggressive"".  Many different funds, some did okay, others not.  I decided to consolidate.  I put 60% into FXIAX, a fidelity low expense (.02%) S&P500 fund.  I put the rest in two others that ""made sense"" I guess.  One is FEGRX.  I put 25% into this one as it is really the only global fund available that seems to perform okay.  The problem is the expense ratio is is .79% which seems massively high based on what i've read.  Again, there don't seem to be many options.  The third fund that I have the rest in is labeled as a Bond fund called PONPX.  Again, high expense ratio of .93%.

I know I should be diversified in my 401k, but are these expense ratios just crazy?  Would it be smarter to put it all in the Fidelity fund?  The plan also offers VFIUX (.10%) and DIPSX  (.11%).  I know the bond market has been crap, but these lower expense funds have lost much more than the higher expense fund over the last 5 years.

Is there a no brainer pick between these that I'm missing?  I'm 49 and I have a separate investment account for my wife and I where we have voo, bnd and vxus.  Any help would be appreciated.

I was looking into Vanguard mutual funds as they have the highest reputation. 

I currently already have $35k invested into VOO through Robinhood. 

I was wondering what it’s the difference in investing that same money through Vanguard’s site into their mutual funds?

It seems as if it’s the same exact thing but I could be missing something. 

Can someone please give me some insight? I’m hoping I’m not wasting “time” going through a brokerage instead of the actual mutual funds on site. 

Thanks. ",positive,0.9989311099052429,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lzl6oy/vanguard_site_or_through_brokerage/,

I've been looking more and more into ETFs and the stock market in general recently and finally wanted to start investing in the form of a savings plan...

After some back and forth thinking, I have now come up with these two candidates to start with:

 iShares MSCI ACWI UCITS ETF (Acc) WKN: A1JMDF

or

Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF (USD) Accumulating WKN: A2PKXG

Which of the two would you choose?
Many thanks for the answers in advance ;)

2025-07-14 08:23:34,reddit,Why i hold UNH while reducing positions on other stocks,"From April to July 2025, institutions were quietly accumulating **UnitedHealth (UNH)** adding **\~12 million shares** and increasing portfolio allocation by **\~34%**.

We're talking **Vanguard (+8M)** and **BlackRock (+2.3M)**

At the same time, due to market uncertainty, filings show many funds were trimming **TSLA, NVDA, and even AAPL**, yet UNH got more love.

Then in June? A **$6.2M LEAPS call sweep** (Dec 2025, $290 strike). This isn’t retail peasants like us trading daddies money.   
That’s smart money making a long-dated, high-conviction bet.

# Here's where it gets juicy:

* End of June: Short interest spiked, price dipped below support
* Early July: Price reversed hard → shorts got nuked
* Classic bear trap setup + quiet accumulation by institutions

#  What to Expect

* Late July = potential breakout trigger from earnings or on the run up to earnings.
* **Fake dip likely** → don’t get shaken
* If fundamentals hold, holding firm may outperform chasing 

Institutions are already positioned they don’t need perfect timing, they need long-term upside

If earnings later this month show:

* Stable cost ratios
* Good Medicare enrollment
* No DOJ bombshells ... then the accumulation zone around $290–305 may end up being the best entry range",neutral,0.5778287053108215,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lzgx86/why_i_hold_unh_while_reducing_positions_on_other/,UNH

Normally I got 30 years  before I think about touching the money for retirement so I can ride out dips/bear markets no issue. But if I have a medical expense and need to use my HSA I would be locking in a massive loss. How do you navigate this. Do you use safer ETFs like SCHD or bonds to give more stability? I try to keep a good chunk in the cash account since it's 4% apy and it will give some good flexibility but beyond this what else can I do. Am I over thinking this? 

Edit: I know I can save receipts and reimburse later I'm thinking more so about actually needing the cash in the moment. I do try to save receipts and not reimburse now but if I do need to tap my funds to pay an expense then I lock the loss.

>

>The billionaire entrepreneur, responding to a post on X, said any decision to back the startup ultimately wasn’t his to make. Musk asked X users publicly last year if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, writing at the time that he was just testing the waters. But he said then that the EV maker’s board and backers would need to green-light such a decision.

>Musk set up xAI in early 2023, months after OpenAI ushered in the AI boom with the launch of ChatGPT. It’s since merged with the social media service X in a deal Musk said valued the AI startup at $80 billion and the social network company at $33 billion.

>

>The potential investments emerged as the combined entity XAI Holdings engages in talks to raise money at a valuation of as much as $200 billion, Bloomberg News has reported. They suggest Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer is seeking to more closely entwine the various parts of his corporate empire.

>

>This month, the CEO revealed Tesla will adopt Grok within vehicles - days after the bot posted antisemitic content on X. The integration suggests an expanded relationship between the two firms, something some Tesla investors have called for as EV sales have slumped.

>

>Tesla disclosed in April that xAI was a customer last year, with the startup incurring $198.3 million of expenses tied to commercial, consulting and support agreements with the carmaker. The bulk of that business - $191 million - involved xAI purchasing Tesla’s utility-scale energy storage batteries, called Megapack.

Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3% during events that included Amazon Prime Day, Adobe said on Saturday, compared with [its projections of ](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-set-lift-us-online-sales-238-billion-adobe-estimates-2025-07-07/)28.4%.

Online retail sales in the U.S. rose 11% to [$14.2 billion a year ago](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-prime-day-boosts-us-online-sales-142-bln-adobe-says-2024-07-18/).The Prime Day event has also been cemented as a ""back-to-school"" shopping moment, as consumers jumped on early deals to stock up on essentials and get ahead of the back-to-school rush, Adobe said.

Several major retailers including e-commerce giant [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) [(AMZN.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AMZN.O), Walmart [(WMT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/WMT.N), Target [(TGT.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TGT.N) as well as Best Buy [(BBY.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/BBY.N) have been launching deal events with strong discounts, encouraging shoppers to trade up on expensive items they might normally pass on.

[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) extended its sales window to 96 hours, up from the typical 48, featuring aggressive promotions on categories ranging from apparel to electronics.

A wave of enticing deals comes at a time when heightened trade tensions amid the Trump administration's volatile tariff policies have rattled consumers and businesses, and as the new August 1 deadline for countries to renegotiate trade agreements with the United States looms.

According to the report, shopping on mobile was the dominant transaction channel during the Prime Day event, driving 53.2% of online sales, above Adobe's forecast of 52.5%.

**Ticker:** $YOU

**$$$ Scroll to the end if you want the ADHD Portfolio Manager's Cliff Notes $$$**

YOU has been quietly cashing checks while everyone's been distracted by NVDA vs. ARM cage matches. Im talking real profits, government-grade access, and a fat pile of cash. The cherry on top? They're pivoting into a another revenue stream. They have a B2B SaaS expansion plan that (might) just take them from TSA side hustle to enterprise verification empire.

**So who is YOU anyway?**

Clear Secure is the company behind those VIP ""skip the line"" biometric lanes in airports, stadiums, and other big venues. It's the TSA PreCheck if TSA actually moved at human speed. They call it Clear Plus, and it's already used by 30M+ people.

Then there's the revenue pivot... CLEAR1, a B2B identity verification platform. Think: LinkedIn, Uber, and even T-Mobile using Clear tech to make sure users/employees aren't bots or stolen IDs. IF that hits? You're looking at a low-key SaaS transformation.

**Lets talk money**

* FCF margins: 40%+
* GAAP profitable with net income up 6x YoY
* Zero debt, $1.3 billie in cash (if you did the math then yes... That's $9-10/share just sitting there)
* And they're buying back shares AND paying a dividend like a grown up (isnt that cute)

**What can send this thing on the next flight to the moon?**

* CLEAR1 traction. Need some proof of concept? They just inked 20+ enterprise deals. $TMUS already live
* Index inclusion or analyst upgrades
* Expansion into new airports/stadiums/venues... aka more sticky skip the line subscribers trying to cut you in line (dont we love those guys...)

**No Risk No Reward am I right?**

Risks include:

* If CLEAR1 fizzles and ends up being a LinkedIn footnote
* Leadership shakeup (founder/CFO stepped down recently)
* Some political grandstanding kills airport access

**Is it a good risk reward profile?**

* Floor: Strong cash pile, recurring subs, no debt. It would take a lot to set this thing below $20 so thats where I am estimating the floor.
* Ceiling: Mid thirties is totally reasonable on execution, possibly $40+ if CLEAR1 becomes the next Okta-for-humans
* Current PPS: $29
* Target PPS: $34-36
* Expected Upside: Approx 20-25%
* Divvy? Small, but real .6% plus buybacks

The market still sees this as a fancy airport perk company. What I see is optionality and a floor.

**$$$ TL;DR  for my fellow ADHD Portfolio Managers: $$$**

* Real biz, real margins, real upside
* B2C moat + B2B growth = Juicy hybrid
* CLEAR1 is the wildcard that could re-rate the company to the upside
* Floor's solid, ceiling's open. Short interest adds some spice
* If they execute, $YOU could quietly double in 2-3 years. If not? Still not trash

Summary Stats:

* Target: $34-36
* Current: $29
* Upside: 20-24%
* Grade: Pearl-ish if they dont fumble the bag",positive,0.9999532699584961,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lz484q/from_boarding_pass_to_cash_stack_yous_identity/,

* Currently,  Support is at $20.34, and Resistance is at $22.57.  If it breaks the $22.57 Resistance, then the next Resistance is at $28.40.
* SoFi gained 14.59% in 5D; 42.48% in 1M; 50.68% in 6M; and 204.16% in 1Y.
* Momentum, Sentiment, Recognition, Galileo Tech powering other financial institutions, the increasing rate of closure of brick-and-mortar stores (stores are expensive to maintain, and cuts deep into profit margin), much higher Fintech banks APY, and the uprising of Fintech banks with a bank charter are all propelling each other to cause a domino effect in lifting SoFi's stock price. 
* The Upcoming Crypto, Recent SoFi Invest updates, Fed Student Loan interest rate resumption on August 1^(st), expanding Home Mortgage Loans with the likely interest cuts in 2025, Galileo Tech, Fintech Banks gaining financial market share, and aggressive Loan Platform Business (LPB) expansion with over 50% of SoFi's revenues from non-lending capital-light streams are all raising the outlook of SoFi's upcoming revenue to higher highs.
* 13 consecutive quarters of greater than the Rule of 40, and probably 14 consecutive quarters by the July 29^(th) earnings release announcement.  Q2 2025 is very likely to be the 7th consecutive profitable quarter since Q4 2023.
* Every area in SoFi is using AI, and Cash Coach will be SoFi's AI attempt for personal customization for money advice.
* Over 30% revenue growth, able to maintain more than 30% members and product growth, and don’t see that slowing down, as mentioned by SoFi’s CEO on July 10^(th).
* SoFi is in the run-up trend and will probably break its 52-week ATH multiple times this year. It is the Signs of the Times for Traditional banks as Fintech banks take a much bigger chunk of the financial market. Just like Amazon has dominated the shopping business, while Retail stores are operating on a smaller scale.  The Traditional banks and Fintech banks will coexist, but the Fintech banks are shifting the future of banking by substantially gaining market share to meet the demand of the new generation.

SoFi's fintech primarily comprises two core technologies powered by Galileo Financial Technologies (Originally Galileo and Technisys), which enables SoFi to function as the ""AWS of Fintech."" This technology sector of SoFi substantially increases revenue with relatively low overhead costs, which will significantly help SoFi stock attain higher multiples than traditional banks.

I personally think we have nothing but more and more inflation on the horizon. Believe we've all but given up the aspiration to drive inflation at or below 2%. Does increased inflation then create even more outflows from equities, as Boomers seek liquidity to support themselves?

Ultimately, Millenials and Gen X (or at least those who were lucky enough to invest meaningfully in 401ks and taxable accounts) could be the remaining bag holders.

For example, watches, pokemon cards, art, and so on. Figured I'd add property to this list to find out if there's a good alternative to REITs. I'm not interested in random sites that have zero responsibility to investors. It'd just be an entity that owns these things and stores the items. If it was an ETF, the market cap at IPO is just the combined value of all the items. The ETF fee would just be for storage/security/maintenance and I suppose some income for whoever runs it.

I was very disappointed in REITs. Their value doesn't at all sync up to the value of property (property values go up and REITs still somehow fall). I also have no idea at all how to tell if the market cap is way above what they actually own so I'd appreciate knowing how to figure that out. You kinda get rental income, but I don't want to put money into an REIT that could potentially have twice the market cap of the property they hold. No idea what the case is for ETFs like GLD either (if market cap is about what the physical gold is worth, then I think that's great).

EDIT: I know that supply/demand can affect market cap, but my assumption is that if market cap well exceeds the value of the items it holds, it's not rational. If the market cap is below the value of the items, well, that's just a deal. Not sure if the term market cap exists outside of stocks, but hopefully you know what I mean. Ideally the entity would just outright say what they own along with the values, I don't consider that as too much to ask.",positive,0.9999830722808838,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lyyfw8/investing_in_items_collectibles_art_property_gold/,

This marks a shift from the $160B in inflows between mid-2023 and early 2025

Look at this info below I compiled from research, and tell me we are not on the cusp of something BIG?

According to recent reports (as of early July 2025):

* **Cumulative Net Inflows:** Spot Ethereum ETFs have accumulated **over $5 billion** in cumulative net inflows since their launch in July 2024. Some reports specify the figure as high as **$5.31 billion**.
* **Recent Momentum:** Notably, these ETFs have seen a strong surge in inflows recently. For instance, in the first 11 days of July 2025 alone, they recorded **$890 million** in inflows, putting July on track to be their best-performing month since launch. One specific day, July 10, 2025, saw a massive **$383.1 million** in net inflows, with BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) leading significantly with over $300 million on that day.
* **ETH Acquired:** Over the past nine trading days (leading up to mid-July 2025), these ETFs have acquired nearly **380,000 ETH**, which is a significant amount and, interestingly, exceeds the total net ETH issuance since The Merge in September 2022.

Ethereum has demonstrated fast growth recently and consistent demand, especially in the recent months of 2025. This indicates increasing institutional appetite for Ethereum, and why we are seeing these price increases.

Now I have moved to a tax heaven with a very low cost of living, and I secured a very stable freelancing gig for years, paying around 5k euros monthly while my expenses are maximum 2k, if I go out a lot and order and go on vacations plus rent and all.

Should I focus on making more, getting a side freelancing gig for increased income, or focus on spending less and being frugal? Or both? 

For now monthly investing is around 3k on the day I get my salary. I dump them into a custom pie of VOO and nasdaq 100 (60% SP and 40% nasdaq) DCA’ing 100 daily. If I have spare cash or another gig, I DCA them into a automated dividend pie. 

I know I need much more patience but it’s very very hard. I want more, either from investing or from what I earn or from what I save.

I made very good gains those past years, but my pile was just not big enough for it to count much. I want more one way or another.

Any tips? I also want to live a bit as I am young and I already sacrificed years of my youth working in a basement in complete solitude.

I am all about compound interest but it’s so damn hard getting to 80k and then to 100k. I suppose after that it starts to get easier psychologically.",positive,0.9986673593521118,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lyrqs7/23_yo_finally_got_a_good_salary_and_saved_some/,YO
2025-07-13 11:21:55,reddit,Powell's ouster 'one of the biggest underestimated event risks in the coming months,"U.S. President Donald Trump's potential removal of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could lead to a ‘meltdown’ in currency and bond markets and a spike in inflation expectations, Deutsche Bank said on Friday.

Earlier this week, Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, accused Powell of ‘gross’ mismanagement of the Fed and said renovations to the Fed's headquarters were ‘way over budget’ and that the cost of the project had ballooned to about $2.5 billion.

The allegation could open the door for Trump to seek Powell's removal. The president has repeatedly criticised the Fed chairman for failing to lower interest rates and has hurled a series of insults at him. He has reportedly considered firing Powell and appointing a successor before the end of his term.

George Salaveros, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, noted that the market now expects Powell's ouster to be very unlikely. According to forecasting platform Polymarket, the likelihood of Powell stepping down is currently 15 per cent.

But Salaveros offered some thoughts on the possible implications.

He says: ""The empirical and academic evidence on the impact of a loss of central bank independence is fairly clear: in the extreme case, both currency and bond markets could collapse as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall, and broader risk premiums rise due to institutional erosion. Interestingly, the implications for equities are even more ambivalent given that they are ultimately a claim on real assets.""

It is difficult to quantify the impact on FX and interest rates, but in the first 24 hours after Powell's announcement of his departure, we expect the trade-weighted dollar to fall by at least 3-4 per cent, while US fixed income will suffer a 30-40 basis point sell-off, led by the back end,’ Salaveros said.

According to the analyst, the market's reaction to the initial news will depend on whether the remaining Fed policymakers ‘agree’ around the central bank's independence, the choice of Powell's successor, and the broader macroeconomic context.

He added: ‘All in all, we see Chairman Powell's departure as one of the biggest underestimated event risks in the coming months.’

This week, trade dynamics have been at the centre of Wall Street's attention, overshadowing monetary policy and the Federal Reserve.

>Google has agreed to pay about $2.4 billion in a deal to license the technology of AI coding startup Windsurf and hire its CEO and some of its employees, according to people familiar with the matter.

>The deal comes after talks for OpenAI to acquire Windsurf stalled, the people said.

>The Alphabet GOOGL unit is hiring a small number of Windsurf employees to focus on agentic coding within its DeepMind division, and the tech giant will also acquire a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf’s technology.

>Google isn’t taking a stake in Windsurf. Most of Windsurf’s existing employees will remain at the company.

>OpenAI first struck an agreement to buy the startup for $3 billion a few months ago in an effort to boost the growth of its AI coding products. But the deal hit a roadblock after Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, objected to some of the terms, The Wall Street Journal reported.

>OpenAI didn’t want to give Microsoft access to Windsurf’s technology. Under their current contract, the tech giant is entitled to all of the startup’s intellectual property.

>The failed talks are a setback for OpenAI, which is racing against other tech companies to build AI coding assistants, one of the largest new markets enabled by generative AI, and shows how tensions with its largest partner are hampering major business efforts. It is also another example of the pitched battle going on between Silicon Valley giants to hire and retain the most talented AI scientists and engineers.

>Tech giants have pursued similar “acquihire” deals as a way to attract top startup talent while avoiding the scrutiny of antitrust regulators. Google last year paid $2.7 billion to hire its former researcher, Noam Shazeer, and license technology from the startup he started, Character.AI. Microsoft and Amazon have also struck similar deals with startups.

>Google negotiated its deal with Windsurf after the exclusivity window for talks between OpenAI and Microsoft fell through. Tech news site The Verge earlier reported on some aspects of Google’s deal.

2025-07-12 22:58:13,reddit,"Thoughts on the Trump Account, aka ""Baby Bonds"", recently passed into law?","Starting July 2026, parents will be able to contribute $5,000 per year into an IRA for any child under 18 that will be invested in US equities. For U.S. citizens born between Jan 1st 2025 and Dec 31st 2028 the U.S. government will deposit an initial $1,000 to seed the account.   

If fully funded for all 18 years, the child will have $90k principle invested, most likely it'll be around \~150k accounting for inflation and growth. 

There's some interesting thoughts about doing Roth conversions after age 18 when the child will now be in college and probably in a low income brackets till age 23. 

For most middle class families this will be another tax-advantaged space they won't be able to take advantage of or it'll compete for the same dollars that could otherwise be invested in a 529 plan.   
  
For those families that do have the resources, it appears that Trump accounts can effectively function as a stealth Roth IRA account that will essentially grow tax free till retirement (\~$3 million in today's dollars by age 65).   
  
There's still a lot of questions to be answered over the next 12 months before this becomes available; what type of ETFs or funds parents can choose from, expense ratios, participating institutions, ability to do rollovers or conversions, etc...

>The London-bound plane had barely left the runway at Ahmedabad airport when it hurtled back to earth. Everyone on board was killed, except for one passenger.

>According to the report by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, obtained by CNN, the fuel control switches in the cockpit of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner had been flipped, starving the engines of fuel. The report does not say whether the control switches were flipped by a person or in another way.

>Investigators were able to get data out of the plane’s “black box” recorders, including 49 hours of flight data and two hours of cockpit audio, including from the crash.

>The aircraft had reached an airspeed of 180 knots when both engines’ fuel cutoff switches were “transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec,” according to the report.

>“In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report reads.

>Shortly after, the switches were reversed back to where they should have been, and the engines were in the process of powering back up when the crash happened.

>On the 787, the fuel cutoff switches are between the two pilots’ seats, immediately behind the plane’s throttle levers. They are protected on the sides by a metal bar and have a locking mechanism designed to prevent accidental cutoff.

>Airport footage shows the Ram Air Turbine, an emergency power source on an aircraft, deployed during the plane’s initial climb after takeoff, the report said. The plane started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall.

>“When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction,” the report states.

>Seconds after the engines attempted to relight, one pilot called out, “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY.” The controller called out for the plane’s callsign, but didn’t get a response and watched the plane crash in the distance.

>The fuel switches were “designed to be intentionally moved,” according to CNN safety analyst David Soucie, who said cases in which all fuel switches were turned off accidentally are “extremely rare.”

>“Throughout the years, those switches have been improved to make sure that they cannot be accidentally moved and that they’re not automatic. They don’t move themselves in any manner,” Soucie said on Friday.

>The captain of the flight was a 56-year-old who had flown more than 15,000 hours in his career. The first officer was a 32-year old man with over 3,400 flying hours.

>Investigators also noted settings on equipment found in the wreckage was normal for takeoff. The plane’s fuel was tested and found to be of satisfactory quality, and no significant bird activity is observed in the vicinity of the flight path, according to the report.

>The takeoff weight for the plane was found to be within allowable limits, and there were no “Dangerous Goods” on the aircraft. Investigators found the flaps on the wings of the plane were set in the 5-degree position, which is correct for takeoff, and the landing gear lever was in the down position.

>The left engine was installed on the plane on March 26 and the right was installed on May 1, the report said.

>One of the relatives of an Air India victim called for the perpetrators to be punished following the release of the preliminary report. Naresh Maheswari, whose son died in the crash urged the investigators to be neutral, telling India’s ANI news agency that “we want no one else to die due to such carelessness.”

>The brother-in-law of another of the victims, Niraj Patel, said: “We want the government to take all kinds of precautions so that people do not lose their family members to such incidents again.”

>The Air India jet took off from Ahmedabad’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in India’s western state of Gujarat on June 12. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner was headed to London Gatwick and scheduled to land at 6:25 p.m. local time.

>Air India had said 242 passengers and crew members were on board. That included 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian.

>In addition to those on board, a number of people on the ground were killed when the plane crashed into the BJ Medical College and Hospital hostel.

>The crash resulted in 260 fatalities total, according to the report. A number of the dead on the ground resulted from the plane hitting the hostel.

>Air India acknowledged that it received the report and said it will continue cooperating with authorities in the investigation.

>“Air India stands in solidarity with the families and those affected by the AI171 accident,” the airline posted to X on Saturday (local time). “We continue to mourn the loss and are fully committed to providing support during this difficult time.”

I lost most of her portfolio 3 months ago in April (bottom tick was $800k) but have been able to grow it back to a much higher value than it was before the tariff BS.

Total gains in 18 months: $4,000,000

I have been trading options (obviously, this is WSB.) For the first 6 months, my big winner was HIMS, although I sold WAY too early. I bought calls around $10 and sold around $20-$24. My other big plays have been scalping NVDA and especially GOOGL. Despite being a lousy hold for the last year, I've consistently YOLO'd into GOOGL on big pull backs, including the Apple congressional testimony news (Google searches were down for the first time on Safari, although Google denied this.)

My strategy is to buy near or at-the-money calls 2-5 months out with at least one earnings in between. I don't usually hold through earnings. I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table. Because the calls are many months out, there isn't too much theta decay if the stock goes sideways.

I generally keep cash on the side to YOLO into calls if there's a huge overreaction on a given ticker. If I'm fully invested, it's hard to take advantage of certain opportunities. I don't think I have that much patience, but I've definitely improved since my early trading days.

On Friday I sold most of the portfolio and am now 85%  in cash. The other 15% is in QQQ puts and UNH calls.

Trump will impose a 30% tariff on Mexico due to fentanyl crossing the border and the same tariff rate on the EU as a result of the U.S. trade deficit.

2025-07-12 12:53:10,reddit,"Trump Says US to Impose 30% Tariffs on EU, Mexico Next Month","Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump unleashed his latest tariff ultimatums, declaring a 30% rate for Mexico and the European Union, as his trade agenda continues to keep allies off balance and inject uncertainty into global financial markets. 

Trump made the announcement in two letters posted to social media Saturday as he informed key trading partners of new rates that will kick in on Aug. 1 if they cannot negotiate better terms.

He has spent the week sending out letters to countries, tweaking his proposed tariff levels from April and inviting trading partners to negotiate further.

The EU had been hoping to conclude a tentative deal with the EU to stave off the tariff, but Trump’s letter dulled optimism for an 11th-hour agreement between the major economies.

“The European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States,” Trump said, or “whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added on too the 30% that we charge.”

In his letter to Mexico, Trump said the country has been “helping me secure the border,” but added that it wasn’t enough.

“Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground. Obviously I cannot let that happen!” Trump said in the letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.",positive,0.9989364743232727,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lxzqzs/trump_says_us_to_impose_30_tariffs_on_eu_mexico/,Impose

(Reuters) -President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose a 30% tariff on imports from Mexico and the European Union starting on August 1, after weeks of negotiations with the key U.S. allies and top trading partners failed to reach a comprehensive trade deal.

In an escalation of Trump's trade war, the fresh tariffs were announced in separate letters to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum posted on Truth Social on Saturday.

The European Union and Mexico are among the largest U.S. trading partners.

Trump has sent similar letters to 23 other U.S. trading partners this week, including Canada, Japan and Brazil, setting blanket tariff rates ranging from 20% up to 50%, as well as a 50% tariff on copper.

The August 1 deadline gives countries targeted by Trump's letters time to negotiate a trade deal that could lower the threatened tariff levels.

The EU had hoped to reach a comprehensive trade agreement with the U.S. for the 27-country bloc.

Three EU officials told Reuters on Saturday that Trump's threats represent a negotiating tactic.

Trump's letter to the EU included a demand that Europe drop its own tariffs, an apparent condition of any future deal.

""The European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large Trade Deficit,"" Trump wrote.

EU President von der Leyen said the 30% tariffs “would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.”

She also said while the EU will continue to work towards a trade agreement, they “will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required.”

Canada got a higher tariff rate of 35% compared to Mexico, with both letters citing fentanyl flows, even though government data shows the amount of the drug seized at the Mexican border was significantly higher than the Canadian border.

""Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough. Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels who are trying to turn all of North America into a Narco-Trafficking Playground,"" Trump wrote.

Mexico sends more than 80% of its total exported goods to the U.S. and free trade with its northern neighbor drove Mexico to overtake China as the U.S.'s top trading partner in 2023.

The European Union had been bracing for the letter from Trump outlining his planned duties on the United States' largest trade and investment partner after a broadening of his tariff war in recent days.

The EU initially hoped to strike a comprehensive trade agreement, including zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods, but months of difficult talks have led to the realization it will probably have to settle for an interim agreement and hope something better can still be negotiated.

The 27-country bloc is under conflicting pressures as powerhouse Germany urged a quick deal to safeguard its industry, while other EU members, such as France, have said EU negotiators should not cave into a one-sided deal on U.S. terms.

Trump's cascade of tariff orders since returning to the White House has begun generating tens of billions of dollars a month in new revenue for the U.S. government. U.S. customs duties revenue shot past $100 billion in the federal fiscal year through to June, according to U.S. Treasury data on Friday.

2025-07-11 23:03:05,reddit,I thought Americans were the regardest. Then I discovered the Indian derivatives trading market,"Apparently in 2024 India accounted for 84% of all equity  option contracts traded globally. The volume of contracts has more than doubled yoy since 2020. Apparently the rise in contracts is due to retail investors having now access to options, and in particular 0dte options. 9 out of 10 retail investors in India are losing money, despite the Indian index crashing the  S&P500 in the past 5 years. Reuters says that more than 40% of derivatives traders were under 30, and over three-quarters earned less than 500,000 Indian rupees, or about $6,000, per year"". 

Congrats guys, you are smashing! What's the equivalent of a Wendy's there?
