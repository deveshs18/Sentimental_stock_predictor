Alright regards, I'm back after mentally recovering from paper handing my TSLA puts on possibly the craziest timed DD ever right before Orange tragically dumped Enron (check out my profile if you wanna read through that clusterfuck). With help from my AI therapist, I've recovered and I've moved on to the next play.

Today's topic is CLBR: a right-wing SPAC merger taking GrabAGun public into the ticker PEW (think Star Wars like how those guns go pew pew, pretty dope) so grab a strong drink and sit down cuz we're gonna be comparing it to DJT and how CLBR is likely to mimic that merger but with extra regard strength.

**Status of CLBR merger:**  
CLBR just submitted their 3rd revision of the S-4 (form the SEC requires for mergers). I did a PDF comparison between the 2nd and 3rd revision. They didn't change much, mostly cosmetic stuff as well as some extra outlined risks the SEC probably asked for. The document looks pretty solid. Therefore, I believe it is extremely close to getting approved by the SEC. I estimate it could be as soon as tomorrow. If not tomorrow, definitely next week.

When the S-4 was approved in the DJT merger, DWAC (the sponsor company like how CLBR is the sponsor company for GrabAGun) jumped something like 14%. Not bad.

**What happens after S-4 approval?**  
The shareholders will schedule a date to vote on the merger (spoilers, they will vote yes). When this was announced in the DJT merger, stock fell like 7% ish. Then when the actual merge date was announced, it initially rose then fell something like 14% on the news.

If the same happens with CLBR this will likely be a great entry point for anyone that missed out on S-4 approval. I'm probably going to increase my position if this happens.

**What happens on merge date?**  
We all know what happened to DJT, it made a lot of lucky fucks very wealthy.

***The risk-reward here is just too good to pass up imo.***

**BONUS POINTS**  
That's right regards, I'm not done so grab another drink if you need it.

**Orange Jr.**  
He's directly involved in this merger. We all know how much that family loves to cause a good pump (and eventually dump).

**Financials**  
Unlike Truth Social at the time, GrabAGun is an actual profitable, positive cash flow company. That means that this merger is likely to benefit from both the **meme stock regards (us)** as well as **actual smart investors (not us/other people)**.

In other words, this merger is gonna have both **regard strength** and **fundamental strength**. I wish I could say the same about myself but unfortunately I'm only regard strength.

**Bank Policies**  
Banks are changing their policies with respect to getting involved with companies in the firearms business. And who caused this change? That's right, Mr. Orange Man himself.

Headline: ""Citigroup Reverses Its Firearms Policy Months After Trump Called Out U.S. Banks. Here‚Äôs What to Know""

Pretty good timing for a company like GrabAGun, especially considering Orange's son (Orange Jr.) is directly involved. I wonder what else he could say to pump the shit out of this?

**Wartime and Political Uncertainty**  
What do people buy when they think WW3 is about to drop harder than a Drake album? Guns.

**Kelly Reisdorf Added to Board of Directors**  
She's the CEO of USA Shooting, I see future revenue streams opening up with this.

**What my AI Therapist has to say after I told it to do hella research:**  
""VI. Strategic Conclusion for the Sophisticated Investor

The public offerings of DJT, PEW, and NMAX signal the maturation of a distinct and challenging asset class: the politically-branded meme stock. These investment vehicles are defined less by their products or financial statements and more by a powerful narrative that transcends business fundamentals, a reliance on a central political figurehead, and a dedicated base of retail investors who view their participation as an ideological act.

For DJT, the narrative *is* the product; its valuation is a direct reflection of sentiment surrounding Donald Trump, with little to no underlying business to support it. For NMAX, a similar political narrative combined with a low-float IPO structure fueled a brief but spectacular speculative frenzy. The pending PEW merger represents the next evolution of this model. Here, the political narrative serves as a powerful marketing wrapper and valuation accelerant for what appears to be a tangible, profitable underlying business.

The crucial takeaway for the sophisticated investor is the necessity of a dual-track analysis. Traditional fundamental analysis‚Äîevaluating revenue, profitability, cash flow, and competitive positioning‚Äîremains essential for understanding the long-term viability of the enterprise. However, it is insufficient on its own. It must be paired with an equally rigorous analysis of the political narrative's strength, the loyalty of the retail investor base, and the technical factors, like share float and lock-up periods, that can drive short-term volatility.

The interplay, and often the direct conflict, between these two value drivers‚Äîfundamental reality and political narrative‚Äîwill ultimately determine the stock's trajectory. Investing in these entities is not merely a bet on a company's success; it is a complex and high-risk wager on the direction, intensity, and durability of a political movement.""

**EDIT TO INCLUDE COMMENT:**  
Also worth mentioning: with this being firearms and Orange Jr.-related, there's bound to be some controversy. Especially if this gains traction. More news = more pump, especially if say Fox or NewsMax covers it and the rednecks start buying it up.

2025-06-19 15:27:57,reddit,Thoughts on investment strategy,"Hi everyone, 

I'm 39/m, living in Europe, with inherited US dollars in a Schwab international account, so I cannot invest in mutual funds or ETFs, only individual stocks and bonds. Initially I bought multiple US treasuries with various maturity dates from 2025-2032, just to avoid having to think about it. Then, about a year ago, I started investing 750$/month in 15 individual stocks via Schwab's ""stock slices"" service (so 50$ per stock per month), thus slowly increasing the stocks percentage as bonds start maturing and freeing cash. Since I can't just buy a S&P500-ETF, my idea was to represent it with these 15 stocks, focusing mostly on growth/tech, with a few defensive dividend positions as well, and avoiding big finance, fossile energy and defense industry (just personal preference). I'd be curious to hear what people think of my picks: 

Apple / Microsoft / Nvidia / Broadcom / Adobe / PaloAlto Networks / ServiceNow / Merck / Abbvie / Vertex Pharmaceuticals / Procter&Gamble / NextEra Energy / MainStreet Capital / Realty Income REIT / WasteManagement

Any how got me thinking about E*Trade offering basically same fund -ETLGX at a way lower price, and whether or not i should get out of SWPPX and into ETLGX.  Would appreciate feedback from the wiser on getting in on these brand new no fee  funds vs. staying in on current.

2025-06-19 15:00:37,reddit,ELI5 The wheel - The Pokemon analogy,"This is a comment I made in response to a post requesting an eli5 on The Wheel Strategy, which is alternating cash secured puts and covered calls basically. I found this analogy amusing to craft. It's gotten no real love on that post, but I figured some of the slower ones in class here might benefit from the story/explanation. Without further Ado, I present my analogy on the wheel using a story about a Pokemon card.

...

Your second grade brother has a friend in class who is desperate for your mecha-charizard-EX full art foil card. You want no less than $150 for it. You tell your brother you‚Äôll sell it for that much next Friday if he gives you an extra $20 up front to keep it safe until then, but only if it can‚Äôt be found cheaper online before then. By then, the cheapest copy on TCGplayer is $165, so your brother collects your card and gives you the remaining 150 for the card owed to you.

Now you have $170 but no card and you really like that card. So you make another deal through you brother to buy the card back by the start of the new school year from his classmate should the price drop below $120 so he doesn‚Äôt lose too much on a big swing in value, if he just gives you $10 to keep the cash set aside.

Now you have $180 and still no card. The whole summer flies by. On your first day of first grade, that card can be found for $115. You fork over the $120 agreed to for the card. Now you have the card you started with and an extra $60.

You just wheeled that card (or maybe a lot of 100 shares), first selling a call against it for $20 (.20/share) at a strike of $150 for the card (1.50 share price @ 100 shares). The card was called away and you collected 170 total.

You then sold a put with $120 of that cash as collateral to collect $10 premium for a chance to get the card back cheaper. Price drops and you get the card back for the $120 collateral, in other words you have the card put to you. Now you can start over with the same card (or shares) and an extra $60.

Boom. That's the wheel strategy.


Edit: I feel like I should point out, because I didn't specifically mention it... if either a sold cash secured put or covered call expires otm, the premium is held onto by the seller and their collateral is returned. I figured it was self explanatory but didn't want to overlook it by assuming anything.",positive,0.9999271631240845,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1lfczl2/eli5_the_wheel_the_pokemon_analogy/,Pokemon
2025-06-19 14:40:11,reddit,Coreweave 9-19 $150 csps for 192k premium,"Wrote 30 crwv (coreweave) 9/19 $150 csps (cash secured puts) for $62/share premium and 1 crwv 9/19 $150 csp for $64.1/share premium. Max profit $192k, max loss if coreweave goes to 0 is $273k. The $192k premium and $465k ‚Äúcash‚Äù are in money market collecting 4 percent interest, which will yield another $6,700 between now and 9/19.

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:

‚ÄúThe general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies‚Äô collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.

Customers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.‚Äù

Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. 

Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. 

However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability. 

Best case scenario is that coreweave closes in the $150 range with high IV on 9/19 and I get to run it back again, while collecting more premium and interest.",positive,0.9986598491668701,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfchc3,

2025-06-19 14:10:39,reddit,From Decentralized Hype to Centralized Risk: The Stablecoin Trap,"
The new stablecoin legislation that was pushed through the Senate this week effectively ties the U.S. Treasury to crypto, because nothing says ‚Äúsound fiscal footing‚Äù like betting the government‚Äôs cash flow on digital tokens and market hype. 

This new plan forces stablecoins to be backed by short-term T-bills. That creates an estimated $2‚Äì$3 trillion in new demand for government debt, which is nearly half the current size of the T-bill market. On paper, that looks like a win. In reality, it‚Äôs a circular feedback loop: Crypto demand fuels stablecoins, stablecoins buy T-bills, T-bills fund deficits. The government becomes addicted to speculative capital flows. And round and round we go.

It‚Äôll work great, until it doesn‚Äôt. The whole setup depends on risk appetite staying high. Thing is, crypto isn‚Äôt some stable, predictable pillar of the economy. It‚Äôs a sentiment-driven casino, where whales move markets and retail euphoria inflates bubbles. Confidence in that environment can evaporate overnight.

When the music stops, we will see a wave of stablecoin redemptions. To meet those redemptions, issuers have to dump T-bills into the open market. Yields will then spike and liquidity will dry up. Government borrowing costs jump at exactly the worst time. Suddenly, the entire short end of the Treasury curve is caught in a feedback loop running in reverse.

Crypto is becoming exactly what it claimed to replace: a systemic risk the government can‚Äôt afford to let fail. And it won‚Äôt be the VC whales or offshore exchanges who foot the bill. It‚Äôll be the taxpayers, either directly or through backdoor rescues and Fed liquidity if things unravel.

Once you tie public finance to crypto flows, the line between a market correction and a fiscal crisis starts to blur. A major stablecoin unwind won‚Äôt just hit DeFi yield chasers, it‚Äôll slam the short end of the Treasury market. That‚Äôs when the Fed and Treasury will have no choice but to step in, to stabilize yields, backstop liquidity, and calm foreign holders.

So yeah, we‚Äôre already halfway to a too-big-to-fail bailout economy for crypto. Not because it earned that privilege, but because we let it entangle itself in the core plumbing of the financial system.

This isn‚Äôt just risky, it‚Äôs desperate. You don‚Äôt latch public finances to speculative manias unless you‚Äôre out of conventional tools. And if your fiscal strategy depends on token demand holding up, you‚Äôve already lost the plot.

What makes this even more dangerous is the moral hazard baked in. We‚Äôre handing fiscal stability to unregulated private actors, namely stablecoin issuers, hedge funds, and crypto exchanges, many of whom have no oversight and no skin in the game if it blows up. Just like the shadow banks in 2008, they profit on the way up and vanish when the tide goes out.

They‚Äôre calling this ‚Äúfinancial innovation,‚Äù and anyone who questions it a Luddite. But let‚Äôs be clear: this isn‚Äôt modernization. It‚Äôs monetizing the mania and papering over structural deficits by plugging them into whatever speculative engine happens to be hot this cycle.

If this goes sideways, and history says it eventually will, it won‚Äôt just hurt crypto. It could shake global trust in U.S. debt markets, and by extension, the dollar itself. Because now our ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù assets are being propped up by the same forces that gave us meme coins and NFT rug pulls. That‚Äôs how systems collapse, not with one catastrophic decision, but with a series of reckless bets made under the illusion that the good times will last forever.",positive,0.9993321299552917,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lfbs8t/from_decentralized_hype_to_centralized_risk_the/,

I swear half my losses came from indicators that need a week to tell me what happened yesterday. By the time they ""confirm"" anything, the real money's already been made by someone else.

The whole thing is backwards. These indicators use moving averages - they're literally designed to be slow. Waiting for pivot confirmations, crossing signals, divergence ""proof""... meanwhile the stock's already moved 10%.

I have been working on reading momentum differently. Instead of averaged prices over X periods, just watching the actual fight between buyers and sellers as it happens. Like, are buyers getting exhausted RIGHT NOW, not 5 bars from now.

NVDA at $95 was a perfect example. Every traditional indicator said ""wait for confirmation."" But the real-time action was screaming that sellers were done. Next thing you know it's at $145.

That 52% move? Most of it happened while traditional indicators were still ""waiting for confirmation.""

Same story everywhere - SPX reversals, individual stocks, commodities. The exhaustion shows up immediately if you know what to look for. Not after the fact, not next week, but right when it matters.

I had a taxable account in college because I did not earn enough to pay capital gains taxes. The plan was to invest in that, sell right before I got a job incurring no taxes and just reinvest. I ended up having to use the money so not sure if this would have worked. 

As far as I can tell an even bigger loophole if you have a lot in a taxable account is just to take 1 year off work, earn no income or just below the threshold, cash out and with income below the threshold pay no taxes on the gains? 

This also seems like a loophole with retirement making a taxable account functionally a Roth IRA? Could you not just in your first year of retirement with 0 income to report, withdraw all the money from your taxable account tax free?

The agreement is the embodiment of the NEXUS (Neo-Espace pour de multiples Usages S√©curis√©s) program launched by the French Ministry of Defence, which aims to reinforce the current French military space communications model by combining military and civilian resources.

France reaffirms its commitment to the European IRIS¬≤ program, which has been supported from the outset since the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2022. However, the urgency of the international situation means that it cannot wait until then.

As the first concrete step in the NEXUS project, the French defense procurement agency (DGA) has reached a 10-year framework agreement, valued at up to ‚Ç¨1 billion in expenditure, with Eutelsat, covering the supply of priority-access space resources (notably capacity on Eutelsat‚Äôs OneWeb LEO constellation), the hosting of ancillary missions for the French armed forces, and operational and security maintenance. The agreement also covers the upgrading and securing of the constellation for military grade use.

Jean-Francois Fallacher, Chief Executive Officer of Eutelsat commented: ‚ÄúWe are honored at the prospect of supporting the French armed forces through this historic agreement, which underscores the crucial role of low earth orbit satellite capacity in responding to the requirements of contemporary operational theaters. Eutelsat today offers the only commercially operated LEO constellation capable of meeting stringent military standards ahead of the deployment of IRIS¬≤. It provides global coverage, low latency, rapid deployment, and adaptability to mobile use cases, attributes validated by successful large-scale experiments conducted with the French Armed Forces.‚Äù

2025-06-18 23:53:57,reddit,Is SPOT overvalued?,"I understand that stocks can keep moving up longer than anyone expects, but I've been watching Spotify for over a year without buying or shorting, just thinking it has to come down. Especially from January to April when SPOT and many stocks seemed to be creating massive head and shoulders, and proceeded to just run and break that potential setup. 

SPOT's market cap is $145b, they were profitable last year for the first time at $1.23b profit from $17b revenue, now with $8.56b cash and cash equivalents on hand, and with debt of $2.27b. 

They have a P/E of 105 and a forward P/E of 67, with their EPS estimates continuously increasing, but they seem to generally miss these targets, last time being by over 50%.

Is it me, or is the company way overvalued and just floating up, not on any fundamentals?

Like I said, I have no positions for or against the company, I just want to see what people think who have been in this for longer than myself.

2025-06-18 22:45:21,reddit,Gene-Editing Stocks Gain on LLY-VERV Deal Announcement,"Eli Lilly‚Äôs recent announcement to acquire Verve Therapeutics, Inc, a Boston-based clinical-stage company developing genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease, has put the spotlight on other promising companies developing gene therapies.

Post this acquisition, Lilly will add Verve‚Äôs pipeline of gene therapies targeting heart diseases. This includes VERVE-102, an investigational in vivo gene-editing therapy aimed at reducing cholesterol levels.

The share price of other gene-editing companies like Crispr Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics rallied following the announcement. Other companies in this space like Beam Therapeutics were also up. However, share price of Editas Medicine pared most of the gains recorded during the day and ended the session in red.

A Look at Promising Gene-Editing Companies

The rapid evolution of genomics, the study of genes and their functions in recent times has paved the way for a revolutionary era in genetic medicine.

Gene-editing companies hold potential to treat and cure diseases caused by genetic variants. As the name suggests, they make changes or correct defects in the organism's DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a breakthrough in the development of genome editing approaches.

Shares of NTLA were up 6.9% on June 17 on investor optimism about its prospects. Intellia Therapeutics is a clinical-stage gene editing company, focused on developing drugs with CRISPR-based therapies. NTLA is leveraging its modular platform to advance in vivo and ex vivo therapies for diseases with high unmet need.

NTLA‚Äôs leads in vivo product candidates are nex-z for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and NTLA-2002 for the treatment of hereditary angioedema.

CRISPR Therapeutics is rapidly leveraging its CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform to develop therapies for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies, cancer, diabetes and other diseases. Shares of CRSP were up 3.9% on June 17. CRISPR Therapeutics achieved a milestone in November 2023, when it received the first-ever authorization/approval for a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy under the trade name Casgevy. CRSP has collaborated with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals for Casgevy.

Meanwhile, BEAM is advancing a broad, diversified portfolio of base editing programs against distinct, genetically validated editing targets.  The company is currently developing BEAM-101 for sickle cell disease (SCD). The FDA recently granted orphan drug designation to BEAM-101 for SCD.

Editas Medicine is a clinical-stage genome editing biotech developing treatment using its proprietary genome editing platform based on the unique CRISPR technology. The company is currently focusing on in vivo (within the living organism) pipeline development.

Focus on M&A in 2025

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) have picked up significant pace in 2025 in the pharma/biotech sector after a passive run in 2024. The recent spree of acquisitions signifies a focus on portfolio expansion and constant pipeline innovation amid the recent tariff threat.

While oncology and immuno-oncology companies have always been at the top of acquisition targets, the lucrative obesity sector and gene-editing space are also being eyed.

Pharma giant Sanofi recently announced that it will acquire Blueprint Medicines for a total deal value of up to $9.5 billion to expand its portfolio in rare immunological disease and add an early-stage pipeline in immunology. The impending acquisition will add Blueprint Medicines‚Äô only marketed product, Ayvakit (avapritinib), an inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA proteins, to Sanofi‚Äôs commercial portfolio.

In April, pharma giant Johnson & Johnson acquired Intra-Cellular Therapies for approximately $14.6 billion and added antidepressant drug, Caplyta, to its neuroscience portfolio.

Swiss pharma bigwig Novartis, too, has been on an acquisition spree.  Novartis is all set to acquire San Diego-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Regulus Therapeutics to strengthen its renal disease portfolio.

As M&A momentum accelerates across the gene-editing and biotech landscape, stocks like CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, BGM, EXEL, and ARWR may stand to benefit from renewed investor interest and potential strategic partnerships.

M&A activity is expected to accelerate further in 2025, given the massive cash reserve owned by major pharma and biotech companies and intensifying pressure from investors to diversify business.",positive,0.6775268316268921,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1leuykb/geneediting_stocks_gain_on_llyverv_deal/,

The costplusfixedfee award supplements a previously issued contract enhancing design, supply chain and industrial base support across multiple platforms including the Virginiaclass submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers.

$16M in UK funding supports the Common Missile Compartment effort between the U.S. and UK.

Work to be carried out in Groton CT 70% Newport News VA 15% and Quonset Point RI 15%

Completion projected by December 2031

Majority funding from the FY25 National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund ($794.1M).

Oversight by NAVSEA Naval Sea Systems Command in D.C

The deal aligns with Pentagon and Navy strategic guidance for submarine force recapitalization, addressing capacity constraints identified in a recent FY25 industrial base study.

With rising global maritime threats and mounting pressure on U.S. shipyards GD remains a key pillar in sustaining undersea dominance  but execution risk and industry labor challenges persist.

Will GD continue to outperform or is the deck stacked against legacy defense primes in a changing budget environment?

* *""Texas Instruments plans to invest over $60 billion in US to make foundational chips""*  \- Reuters, Bloomberg. 
* Unusual News Volume Factor: 6x its normal. 
* **Stock Reaction: +0.33% today | -0.71% over 5D.** 

News Highlights:  
Texas Instruments (TXN) has announced a sweeping $60 billion commitment to expand its domestic semiconductor operations marking what it calls the largest investment in foundational chip manufacturing in U.S. history.

The investment will fund the construction or expansion of seven chip fabrication plants across three sites in Texas and Utah, including two new facilities in Sherman, TX. The company estimates the initiative will create up to 60,000 jobs across the supply chain and construction ecosystem.

Back in August 2024, TI had outlined a roadmap to build out seven fabs, with projected spending of $40 billion in Sherman and an additional $21 billion across its Utah and other Texas sites. This week's announcement formalizes that vision while slightly increasing the total budget.

The company is aggressively ramping up in-house manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on overseas supply chains and counter the rise of Chinese analog chip competitors. The effort aligns with broader U.S. policy initiatives to reshore critical technology production.

While no detailed timeline was disclosed, Texas Instruments noted that the capital will be allocated over multiple years, with approximately $46 billion earmarked for Texas and $15 billion for Utah. TI emphasized that its long-term capital expenditure plan remains consistent, underscoring a strategic rather than reactive expansion.

They might be a ying and yang to the defense game of the future, think two sides of the same coin.

Now:

If Voyager captures just 1.5% of the initial phase of the Golden Dome budget ($25 billion expected in 2026), its annual revenue that year would increase by approximately 2.5x compared to 2024.

And with $150 billion still to be spent by January 2029 to make the Dome operational, capturing 1.5% of that amount would generate¬†**revenue close to Voyager‚Äôs current market cap.**

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Is MSFT losing strategic leverage here? Or are they just protecting their current ROIÔºüCould this open the door for Google, Amazon, or even Meta to get in bed with OpenAI?How would a fractured OpenAI impact Azure‚Äôs AI moat vs AWS and GCP?MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity

They have low % change because I just bought back after selling it all on Monday after big gains.

DD

Firstly, people love to hate on OKLO and call it overpriced, when it will easily be $100+ when they start producing based on all the contracts they signed and the energy they will sell, which is absolutely genius to do. Their tech isn‚Äôt just making SMRs because they aren‚Äôt the only ones, the smart part is selling the energy itself making it an even safer process. Speaking of safety,

Nuclear is the second safest energy production method after only hydro, by death rate.

Its also insanely cheap after it starts producing, and much more reliable than ones that take less like wind or solar.

It‚Äôs also very clean, even when compared to so called clean options like solar, which arguably cause even greater damage to the environment because of all the cobalt and other minerals that they require to build batteries and other parts, extracted from the horrible mines in Congo. 

People might be thinking it‚Äôs too late, after the boom which came since liberation day. But it‚Äôs really far from over. Uranium prices are only at 75, and they‚Äôve been higher than 100 a few years ago. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you chose a start up like OKLO, or if you chose an established company like Cameco. OKLO and cameco are at their ATH, and cameco has been publicly traded for nearly 30 years already, still growing.

Also, June is normally a slow month in this sector and it‚Äôs doing great, just wait for the better months!

   * View the presentation yourself
   * It sounded quite positive to me
* Perpetua up front expressed the caveat that the presentation contains forward looking statements and to read all the disclaimers on the mentioned slides
* Paulson said they are not going to partner or sell, and made a very convincing argument for this
   * Mainly to due with the importance of gold as uncertainty in fiat currency continues, especially as other regions are placing more importance on their own currencies
   * Also that he believes owning a gold mine is better than owning gold
   * They will be less hindered by not having to work with other partners
   * He is the largest shareholder at around 30% and recently bought $US100M worth of new shares at $13.20
   * He sounded like he is in it long term
   * \[Edit: I forgot to add, he literally called it a dream come true.\]
* Perpetua says this will be the largest independent Gold mine in the USA
* It will also be the ONLY Antimony mine in the USA capable of supplying up to 35% of USA needs (35% figure from previously published reports),
* They expect last state permits this summer
* Perpetua team has a very a great deal (huge) of experience in starting and running mines
* They say with current reserves the price point is at least 3 times where it is now
   * Based on prices lower than today
   * Based on today's prices, much higher
* Also based on currently known reserves
   * But there is a very large quantity of indicated gold reserves based on previous exploration/drilling
      * Previous exploration has shown potential for more substantial reserves
   * They are moving on getting permits for further exploration for this year
   * If confirmed as expected (my opinion sounds like they should based on the presentation) value of shares should be significantly higher
* They are treating antimony as a way to offset gold production costs so that they think cost per ounce gold will be around $450/ounce. (someone please correct me if I'm wrong.)
* I personally like that they mentioned that when current pits are mined out, they will back fill and restore the original river/stream flows in a way making it better for fish habitat
* Antimony will be separated out as part of normal gold processing and then turned into concentrate to be refined elsewhere

Alphabet‚Äôs self-driving car unit announced on Wednesday that it plans to drive vehicles manually in New York, marking the first step toward potentially cracking the largest U.S. city. Waymo said it applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel in Manhattan.

‚ÄúWhile we won‚Äôt be in New York full-time yet, we have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future,‚Äù the company said in an announcement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working towards that goal in a few key ways.‚Äù

If the permit is granted, it would be the city‚Äôs first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles.¬†New York state law currently prohibits a service like Waymo to operate without a driver.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel,‚Äù the company said.

Meanwhile, Waymo is aggressively expanding into new U.S. markets. Waymo One, its ride-hailing service, provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas, and is preparing to bring fully autonomous rides to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., in 2026.

Waymo has made a prior appearance in New York.

The company brought its cars to¬†parts¬†of the city in 2021 for manual driving, data collection and testing. Ethan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, said ‚Äúit was a planned trip with a start and an end.‚Äù The testing allowed Waymo to improve driving in icy and snowy conditions in a densely populated area, the company said.

* US regulators are considering changes to a key capital rule for major banks
* The U.S. central bank announced the board meeting, scheduled for June 25, to discuss changes to the so-called ""supplementary leverage ratio,"" which requires banks to set aside capital against assets regardless of their risk.e Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are reviewing adjustments to the¬†enhanced supplementary leverage ratio that applies to the largest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.
* Under the proposal, the capital requirement for bank holding companies could be reduced to a range of 3.5% to 4.5%, down from the current 5%. The banks' operating subsidiaries would likely see their requirements fall to the same range, compared to the existing 6%.
* Banks say the current requirements are excessive and poorly calibrated, and some of that cash could better serve the economy by being lent out.
* They point to how big banks weathered the COVID-19 pandemic and their role in stabilizing regional banks during turmoil in 2023 as proof that they are resilient and do not need to tolerate more onerous rules.

Shares of Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (VERV) rocketed 75% in pre-market on Tuesday after Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) announced its intent to acquire the company for up to $1.3 billion.

Verve is developing gene editing medicines designed to address the drivers of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as low-density lipoproteins, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a), through treatments that may only need to be given once in a lifetime.

With large-cap names like LLY making bold moves in gene editing, stocks like CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, BGM, ARWR, and EXEL could see renewed attention as investors look for broader exposure across the precision medicine space.

2025-06-17 19:07:40,reddit,"Meta to release smart glasses with Oakley and Prada, extending Luxottica partnership","Meta¬†and¬†EssilorLuxottica¬†plan to release versions of their AI-powered smart glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands, CNBC has learned.

The addition of Prada and Oakley underscore the breakout success Meta had with its second-generation Ray-Ban glasses released in partnership with Luxottica in 2023. The Oakley expansion will be done in partnership with Luxottica, while the addition of Prada signifies Meta‚Äôs first step toward bring its wearable hardware to more fashion companies.¬†

Meta on Monday teased the Oakley release on social media, launching an Instagram account for ‚ÄúOakley | Meta‚Äù with a profile description that reads ‚ÄúThe next evolution is coming on June 20.‚Äù

CNBC reviewed a document that says the new glasses with Luxottica will be¬†aimed¬†at athletes. Meta is¬†targeting¬†active consumers after seeing several owners of its Ray-Ban glasses use the device to record themselves playing tennis, skiing and doing other activities.

The Oakley version of the glasses may cost around $360 as they are more weather resistant than their Ray-Ban counterparts, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the upcoming device. The first version of the Oakley Meta glasses will feature similar technology to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses released in 2023.

Luxottica, based in France and Italy, has licensing arrangements with over 150 brands and owns notable brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.

Meta‚Äôs agreement with Prada comes after the fashion company in December renewed an eyewear-related¬†licensing agreement¬†with Luxottica for 10 years. That deals covers the ‚Äúdevelopment, production and worldwide distribution of eyewear under the Prada, Prada Linea Rossa and Miu Miu brands,‚Äù the companies said at the time.

Besides giving Meta a high-end partnership, the Prada glasses may be a particularly good fit for the tech company as many of the brand‚Äôs models come with thick temples, former Meta employees said. That provides more heft for housing many of the components necessary for smart glasses, including microphones and chips.

It‚Äôs¬†unclear when the Prada deal and product line will be announced.

Meta first partnered with EssilorLuxottica in 2019 to jointly develop the Ray-Ban glasses. The two companies released the first version in 2021, but they found success after the release of the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses in 2023. That version comes equipped with the Meta AI voice assistant and includes features and, when tethered to a smartphone, lets users identify city landmarks, get recipes when looking at ingredients and record and send voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger.

EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February the companies have sold 2 million pairs of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses since 2023. Miller said he aimed to increase annual production to 10 million units by the end of 2026.

Meta and Luxottica¬†announced¬†an extension of their partnership in October, with plans to release more versions of their Ray-Ban glasses. That deal was worth $5 billion, according to¬†a July 2024 report¬†in The Wall Street Journal. As part of the deal, Meta gets exclusive rights to Luxottica‚Äôs brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.¬†

The two companies plan to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC has previously reported.

Competition in the market is heating up.

Last month,¬†Alphabet¬†announced¬†a $150 million partnership¬†with¬†Warby Parker¬†that will see the two companies team up to release glasses infused with Google‚Äôs Gemini AI assistant. The companies plan to release the glasses sometime after 2025.¬†

Snap, meanwhile, announced in June that it plans to release its sixth generation smart glasses under a new brand called Specs. Those glasses, expected for release in 2026, will include augmented-reality technology and will be smaller and lighter than Snap‚Äôs prior products, Snap said.¬†

Meta declined to comment. Luxottica and Prada could not be reached.

Bloomberg News first¬†reported¬†about the Oakley Meta glasses in January.

2. Gross margins are strong at 73%.
3. EBIT margins are slim but positive -  a rarity in the ed-tech world. They are negative for Coursera and Udemy.

2025-06-17 16:33:35,reddit,Sell rental property or keep it?,"Hi All,
I‚Äôm in a financial dilemma and was wondering if there is a different perspective I might be missing here.

I have a rental property that I‚Äôm thinking about selling but I have positive rental income on it currently. 

Here are my financials:

Single, no kids
(Want to get married and have kids in the next 3-4yrs)
Income from job: 160K annually
Primary residence details: 
Mortgage: $672K
Value of primary home: $750K
Rate: 6.25%
Monthly payment: $4900

Primary home is in a developing area, potential for value increase, good school district. Most importantly, I absolutely love living here.


Rental property details:
Mortgage: $332K at 2.75%
Value of rental property: $640K
Monthly mortgage payment and expenses $2050
Monthly rent( after property management fees): $3000

Other financials:
Retirement savings: $190K
Taxable savings: $72K
HYSA: $17K
Debt: mortgages + Auto loan at 1.24% with a balance of $7.3K

I‚Äôve also invested in real estate by building a retirement home for my parents where they live ( outside the US) and the equity on that is ~$450K

Now the dilemma:
Option 1
I‚Äôve lived in the rental property as my primary residence until 2023 april ( at least 2yrs in the last 5yrs) so I won‚Äôt get taxed on capital gains upto $250K if I sold it before April 2026.
My renters are vacating in August 2025 so I was thinking I could sell it then. I would probably gain $270K that I‚Äôm thinking about paying down my current mortgage by $100K and investing the rest in HYSA and ETFs

Option 2 would be to keep renting and possibly incur additional expenses in the future. 
( may not be major expenses since I replaced my AC units and heater in the last 3yrs)
If the rates get lower on my primary home, I could refinance and pay off the loan with the excess funds or even refinance for 15yrs at a lower rate( but cash risky)


I bought my primary home in April 2024. I could move back into my rental property after a year and sell ny primary home but I‚Äôm not inclined to do that since I love living here. I bought this house based on certain future plans of starting a family but that didn‚Äôt work out and life had its own plans. But waking up to the sunlight and this beautiful home is kind of keeping me sane tbh. 

Any perspective appreciated.

So, followup question. As my RMD from my 403b will be here soon ( I'm 71) and we are both still working with a combined annual income of 211K  with no overhead other than a 20K mortgage which will be gone in 2 years if not paid off early, it's definitely not needed. Currently around 50K in savings.

Myself, earning 91K , social security 27K, small pension from 1970 job - $2,500 ( that seemed enormous back then)

Wife 58 yrs old earning 92K  - retirement is still several years off  & maxing out 403b as well.

My 403b is currently 260K & I am maxing it out & at current projections will top 400K in several years with roughly the same math for my wife's.

So, now to the meat of the matter, If I continue to work till my wife can retire in 4-6 years, I'll still be @ my RMD in under 2 years & all it will do is increase our taxable income. I know, worse problems to have but with no deductions & always taking the short form, I REALLY will hate increasing my Fed tax contribution.

‚ÄúLet me correct a misimpression: Eutelsat does not have financial difficulties: No. Eutelsat has a need for financing.

‚ÄúWe at Eutelsat provide our OneWeb network in low Earth orbit that is sovereign and European. There is a real appetite for this sovereignty across the industry,‚Äù he added.

What has happened in Ukraine and the recent statements of Musk, threatening a to stop work on a NASA contract, is an opportunity for us. Here we see what it means that an actor as key as that can threaten to stop service.‚Äù

Nevertheless, the need for extra financing is considerable. While there are numerous reports that Eutelsat is looking for around ‚Ç¨1.5 billion, this might not be sufficient. It is generally accepted that replenishing the OneWeb fleet of 650 craft will cost much more that ‚Ç¨1.5 billion.

* **Low positioning:** With equity exposure historically light, there‚Äôs less forced selling into weakness.
* **Oil‚Äôs muted response:** Brent crude hasn‚Äôt yet surged to levels that threaten growth or Fed rate-cut expectations

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they‚Äôd struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

AMD highlighted its partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Meta Platforms (META), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others at the event. Bank of America analysts believe there‚Äôs another high-profile partner announcement to come: Amazon (AMZN).

Amazon Web Services (AWS) was ""a key sponsor for the event,"" BofA said. However, AWS typically uses its own events to announce new engagements, making a future reveal likely, the bank added.

BofA maintained a ""buy"" rating and price target of $130 following the event. For comparison, the analyst consensus price target from Visible Alpha is about $124.",neutral,0.8275349140167236,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ld4a39/amd_soars_10_as_piper_sandler_raises_price_target/,AMD Soars

Unfortunately, rational value investors have had their worst underperformance ever seen in the data.
