**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

Nvidia is ripping again  are we seriously doing this??So can NVDA break the spell and continue to break new highs?,"NVDA is back on a heater. Stock's flying past $150 and it’s looking like we might break the January highs. Honestly… didn’t think we’d be back here this fast after that dumpster fire earlier this year

Remember when it tanked to the low $90s? Between Trump’s China chip ban, Huawei heating up, and that random DeepSeek AI hype? I thought the bubble had popped. But nope  earnings beat, Saudi/UAE deals, and now here we are again

Now I’m seeing $250 PTs getting thrown around like it’s no big deal. $6T market cap? 

 So real talk:Are you still buying here?Is this just the AI hype train picking up steam again?If you’re holding, are you trimming or riding it out?If not NVDA, what are you playing instead? AMD? AVGO? Or just indexing and chilling?

I’ve been sitting on the sidelines and ngl, I’m feeling a little FOMO

But on the flip side, Nvidia really seems to be a one-of-a-kind presence. While others are still in the middle of a marathon, it's already taking selfies on the podium

Is the Hims selloff overblown,"The company has seen its stock decline by 34% (as of writing) after the cancellation of NVO partnership.

GLP brought in 200m of 1.5b revenue last year so about 15% of total revenues. Is the 30%+ decline for a product that'll still pull in revenues and see an impact of 10ish% max to the company warrant this fall?

Perhaps the rationale is that NVO knows something about upcoming regulation against selling compound GLP products. Or perhaps NVO partnership brought a lot of legitimacy and customers who signed up to get access to Wegovy which will churn.

Anyways is anybody eyeing the stock now that it's fallen so much for a relatively contained revenue drop? ",1750698363.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lim5r9/is_the_hims_selloff_overblown/,stocks

Trump Threatens NATO Allies With Higher Military Spending Or Trade Taxes Will This Affect Markets?,"Trump has just told Spain (and indeed all of Europe) that if they don't pay more for their NATO military  they should be prepared to face higher trade costs - standard Trumpian threat maneuvering  but now that it's in the headlines again, we'll have to see if it has any impact on the markets

Trump suggests that if NATO countries like Spain don't pay more, the US could raise tariffs or trade barriers against them Trump suggests that if NATO countries like Spain don't cough up more money  the U.S  could raise tariffs or trade barriers against them.

If you remember the 2018-2019 trade war  it's not a new thing, but now that it's back in the air  it could spark a new round of concerns about U.S.-European trade friction

Considering that Europe's economic growth is weak right now, and that inflation hasn't come down all the way, they're a lot more afraid of this than the U.S.

Market reaction: 

S&P 500: up 0.2% today, basically not taken seriously 

European Stoxx 50: down about 0.6%, suggesting that European investors are already wary 

US military stocks (e.g. RTX, LMT, NOC): up slightly in pre-market, probably gaming expectations of a possible increase in Europe's military spending 

EURUSD: weakened a bit reflecting a decline in confidence in the eurozone

What are the implications for investors

Benefit: 

military industrial companies Europe if really obedient to increase military spending U.S. defense companies are likely to eat.

U.S.-based industrial stocks If trade barriers rise Manufacturing repatriation concepts to be speculated again (focus on CAT, DE, CMI) 

Risk averse assets If geopolitical tensions escalate Gold and U.S. bonds may attract safe-haven funds

Damage: 

European exporters to the U.S. (e.g., BMW, Volkswagen) may face higher tariffs 

U.S. companies with large operations in Europe (e.g., Starbucks, Apple, Nike) may be pressured by policy uncertainty
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

My take: 

Markets are largely ignoring this at the moment, but if Trump continues to poll higher or European dignitaries publicly respond in a strong way, we can't rule out it becoming a macro risk event 

If that happens, don't be surprised to see volatility spike and Q3 have another tariff scare

Someone talk me out of buying 100 shares of ACHR and forgetting about it for 3 years,"
So Archer is sitting at around $10 right now. According to a recent Pitchstack writeup, they’ve got $2 billion in liquidity after their latest $850M raise. That supposedly gives them enough runway to get through FAA certification and launch commercial services  which is kind of a big deal for a pre revenue company

Their partnerships aren’t fluff either: United Airlines, Delta, Stellantis. Those aren’t speculative letters of intent it’s real validation and access to regulatory + infrastructure support that most eVTOL startups would kill for
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Then there’s the macro setup. The government is actively backing advanced air mobility with executive orders. The regulatory environment is shifting in their favor, and Archer is one of the only players positioned to take advantage of it early. They're calling this a “first mover advantage” in a market that could scale massively by the 2030s

Yeah, it's risky. They’re still burning cash around $450M this year and they haven’t commercialized Midnight yet. But the Abu Dhabi vertiport is being built, pilots are being trained, and the path to actual paid flights is clearer than ever.

The article points out that this stock is still not on many hedge fund radars *(only 33 funds held it last quarter),* which tells me the upside hasn’t been fully priced in yet.

I get that it could go sideways for a while. But if they actually pull off commercial ops, this isn’t a meme, it’s a legit mobility shift.

DeepMind Just Launched AlphaGenome A Big Step For DNABased AI And Genomics,"I don't know how many people have noticed this but Google DeepMind has just released a new tool called AlphaGenome which aims to model how genetic variation affects the biological processes that regulate gene expression.

This is the same team behind AlphaFold and AlphaMissense Unusually instead of limiting itself to the 2 per cent of the genome that codes for proteins the focus of most older models AlphaGenome seeks to account for the remaining 98 per cent known as non-coding regions These regions control the on off switching of genes and are linked to a range of diseaseassociated mutations.

It can analyse up to a million DNA base pairs and predict thousands of regulatory features. Apparently it has already outperformed existing tools in 22 out of 24 benchmark tests and passed 24 out of 26 tests related to identifying disease-associated mutations. That impressive.

This model is a milestone  Caleb Lareau MSKCC 

It brings a foundational level of accuracy long-range context and versatility in a unified model.

Currently it is only available as an Application Programming Interface API and is non-commercial but if this technology is validated and deployed into biotechpharma R&D workflows it could dramatically accelerate rare disease research gene therapy and even cancer diagnostics.

No investment thesis here yet but worth tracking for anyone long on GOOGL This is the kind of moonshot stuff that could pay off 3–5 years down the road, especially as AI moves deeper into biohealth.

Tesla threatened with fine in France over ‘deceptive’ claims,"Investigators at France's competition, consumer affairs and anti-fraud directorate general, or DGCCRF, has demanded that Tesla stop ""deceptive"" claims over the level of autonomy of its cars or face thousands of euros in fines, The Financial Times' Ian Johnston and Kana Inagaki report. An investigation conducted by the DGCCRF found that Tesla engaged in ""deceptive commercial practices"" about the ability of its Tesla vehicles to be ""fully autonomous,"" as well as deceiving customers on the availability of certain options for their cars, the investigators say. Tesla has been ordered to comply with the order within four months or face fines of EUR 50,000 per day for each day that it does not conform.

What stock do you believe in today that others might regret sleeping on in 5 years?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been thinking a lot about those stocks that people believed in early, like Palantir, Tesla, or even Nvidia, and how much they paid off for early investors who held on.

What companies are you currently bullish on for the long term? I’m talking about the ones that you truly believe could grow into something huge in the next 5–10 years, even if they’re small now or not yet mainstream.

I’m not necessarily looking for the next meme stock or short-term swing trades, more the ones that you see potential in based on fundamentals, vision, or tech.

GOOGL, on the other hand, feels like it’s building the future… quietly. Maybe too quietly

"$KO, $PEP and the new Texas health labels","Today I saw that Texas are making companies like $KO and $PEP put health warnings on their beverage  and sweets, as well as Mars' M&Ms (which is rather irrelevant, since Mars is private).

Basically, they've been given until 2027 to remove 40 substances - including bleached flour and artificial dyes.

What hit me was that High Fructose Corn Syrup did not make the warnings list. This wasn't because it was healthy - HCFS was formerly banned by the EU and UK but came off the list in 2017 (probs because of healthy lobbying by Big Sugar (21.3m euros at the last count, not because the EU 'finally saw the light).

But what also hit me is the warnings in Texas WILL be followed by the same in 49 other states (in my view), because states don't want to be seen as encouraging people to eat like s\*\*t, and they are worried about RFKJ and his mad campaign to make everyone better again.

So then what about the shares in $KO and $PEP? With this stuff AS WELL as worries in the Middle East, it is a definitely worrying trend for me.

OpenAI’s Self-Driving Ambitions (with TSLA and GOOG),">The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.

>

>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.

>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.

>“We have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,” Altman said last week on the “Uncapped With Jack Altman” podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, “If our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that’s pretty cool.”

>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI’s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he’s building a direct competitor, xAI, that’s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk’s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in “generalizable” A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

>(OpenAI’s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)

>“I think he really gets it,” Altman said of President Trump’s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) “I think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.”

>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: “I have become a bit more, jaded isn’t the right word, but it’s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.”

>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: “Do you believe that, when you read those things?”

Cool unknown shareholder benefits?,"Hey everyone! I am super interested in individual stocks and also shareholder benefits some may be able to provide. I know that they are fundamentally inefficient, because the amount spent on them could simply be reimbursed as a dividend giving the investors more choice - but I still find them fascinating. My interest in this concept grew when I saw how widespread they are in Japan, with companies offering free meals, gym memberships, and even lounges in malls for owning their stock.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

However, aside from Japan, it is very rare that stocks do offer any kind of benefit other than growth and dividends - at most they offer a negligible discount, or in rare cases cruise ship companies offering onboard credit - for which you obviously still need to spend money on the cruise itself.

Recently, though, I found a super unique shareholder benefit that has NEVER been mentioned on reddit, and wanted to share it with you - as well as ask if you have any similar interesting benefits. Melia Hotels from Spain, offers different loyalty cards for their hotels depending on the amount of shares. And for the modest holding of 10000 shares (roughly 70000€) they offer the highest status.

The platinum card, apparently gives you free room upgrades, lounge access in hotels, welcome gifts, early check-in and late check-out, and most interestingly to me 2 visits in airport lounges per year (according to some sources, others said you get unlimited lounge visits at airports, but I am not sure). Yes, I know the cost of these would be marginal, since a lounge visit costs like 30-50€, but I found it interesting that it is the only non-Japan stock that offers a benefit for ""100%"" free. (Although I guess you still have to book a flight - but thats not related to them).

If anybody has similar stock benefits, I would love to hear about them. Oh - and I know about the 3kg Lindt chocolate you get, but you do need a Swiss adress. I wish they did international shipping, or at least within Europe. I mean, I also wish I had 130,000 Franks to invest in them but thats another story...",1750791918.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ljjwjr/cool_unknown_shareholder_benefits/,stocks

US Consumer Confidence Drops on Broad Concerns About Economy,"Bloomberg) -- US consumer confidence unexpectedly declined in June on concerns about prospects for the economy, labor market and personal finances due to trade policy.

The Conference Board’s gauge of confidence decreased 5.4 points to 93, data showed Tuesday. The figure was below all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 

A measure of consumer expectations for the next six months dropped 4.6 points to 69, while a gauge of present conditions fell 6.4 points to 129.1.

The retreat in confidence erased nearly half of the prior month’s rebound, underscoring lingering anxiety about the potential impacts on the economy from higher US import duties. While inflation over the past three months has been modest, some consumers have become more guarded about their spending.

“Consumers were less positive about current business conditions than May. Their appraisal of current job availability weakened for the sixth consecutive month but remained in positive territory, in line with the still-solid labor market,” Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.

The cutoff date for the Conference Board survey was June 18, five days after Israel launched a series of strikes on Iranian targets. References to geopolitics increased only slightly in write-in responses, according to the survey.

The share of consumers expecting higher interest rates in the year ahead increased to 57%, the highest since October 2023, the Conference Board data showed. ",1750774495.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ljc8dw/us_consumer_confidence_drops_on_broad_concerns/,stocks

Archer Aviation's Midnight Jet Sets Course for Global Takeoff,"Archer Aviation Inc. ACHR, as a prominent electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft developer, is aiming to transform urban air mobility through its flagship aircraft, Midnight. Built  for short, frequent flights of 20–50 miles, Midnight aircraft is nearing its commercial rollout following a handful of regulatory approvals and strategic partnerships ACHR has signed lately.

In June 2025, Archer Aviation signed a strategic partnership with Jetex to develop infrastructure at the latter’s network of private terminals for facilitating Midnight jet’s upcoming commercial air taxi operations. The partnership will initially concentrate on facilities in the United Arab Emirates, with plans to scale across Jetex’s broader portfolio of 40 private terminals in more than 30 countries worldwide.

Prior to this, ACHR joined U.S. and international regulators to launch a five-nation alliance aimed at streamlining global certification and deployment of its Midnight eVTOL aircraft.

With flight testing already underway and certification efforts in progress, the Midnight jet remains well-positioned to take-off smoothly, further supported by the aforementioned strategic moves undertaken by ACHR.

"Question about wash sale. The more I trade, I paranoid. It bothers me, if anyone can help.","I have been reading a lot about wash sale 31 days rule. My understanding is….if you buy A stock on June first. Then you sell with $40. You can claim your $60 loss end of you. If you buy back with 31 days. You are not able to claim. 

However, I don’t know how to apply to a in-and-out scenario. 

Scenario 1:
Buy C stock on July 1 @$1000 total, sold on July 20 @$300. End of year, Dec 31, can I claim $700 as my loss? 
When I can rebuy the stock? Can I rebuy the stock on Aug 22? (More than 31 day I can buy the stock?) 

Scenario 2: 
I have 40 transactions of D stocks, each time I earn $100 thru Aug 1-Aug20. Total will be $4000 (40 transactions x$100). 
Until the 41th time on Aug 25, I lost $3800. So, my actual gain is $200 only.  At this point, my tax will be based on $200? 

Scenario 3 
Continue with Scenario 2. However, If I keep trading, I bought D Stocks back on Aug 26. At the 42th trade, I lost $150. My actual gain will be $4000-3800-150=$50 I guess wash sale trigger, since I bought back within 31 days. If I’m correct…wash sale trigger, I can’t write off $3800 and $150 loss. My tax will be based on $4000? Instead of $50. 

Scenario 4:
Continue with the scenario 2. (Win $4000,loss $3800). I bought back. If my 42th trade, I win $300 on Aug 28
That means $4000-3800+300=$500
Will my tax based on $4000 or $500? Wash sale trigger? 

Scenario 5
Continue with Scenario 2 (Win $4000, loss$3800) Then I buy back with 31 days 10 times. I earn 10k in total. At this point, I think I trigger wash sale. I can’t write off $3800. However, it’s doesn’t matter, since I am winning $10k. I don’t mind to pay tax. My tax will be based on $14k? (My actual earnings is $40000-3800+10k, I still pocket 10,200-the tax on 14k)

I trade daily, but I never claim as a day trader. just don’t want to end up in a hole like Robinhood 800k years ago. If anyone can help, I would appreciate it!",1750865536.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lk8t6i/question_about_wash_sale_the_more_i_trade_i/,stocks
"ACHR trading under $10, good entry or wait for more clarity?","ACHR closed down 1.6% to $10.04, even briefly dipping under $10 during the day. Volume came in light too, with 12.7M shares traded vs the usual 25M+. Quiet move, but here’s what’s interesting:

**Recent analyst activity:**
Despite the slight dip, analysts are mostly leaning bullish:

HC Wainwright raised their PT to $18 (was $12)

Needham, Cantor, and Canaccord all sitting around $13

Average price target is now $13.13


**Earnings update:**
Last earnings beat expectations: -$0.17 vs est. -$0.21
They’re still burning cash (obviously it’s pre revenue), but institutional support remains strong. Hedge funds like Tidemark and Allworth have been quietly adding shares in recent months.

**Insider action:**
CTO and other execs have sold some shares, but nothing alarming. Still holding sizeable positions and no panic exits.

**And now Adam’s tweet:**
This was the real gem. AG dropped a tweet saying eVTOLs won’t just change traffic they’ll change how we think about time, access, even lifestyle. It’s giving “this isn’t just a product, it’s a platform” vibes.

He’s clearly pushing the narrative beyond “flying taxis” and into long term infrastructure/lifestyle disruption.


ACHR TLDR:
Price: $10.04
52W Range: $4.04 - $12.04
Market Cap: ~$5.5B
Average PT: $13.13
Sentiment: quietly bullish
CEO vision: getting bigger than air taxis

**Zoomed out view:**
If AG is right and this becomes a platform shift not just a faster Uber we’re still way early. But with cert milestones being cleared and OEM/manufacturing partnerships in place, the roadmap is real.

**Short view:**
Stock’s had a nice run this quarter, so some chop here is natural. Wouldn’t be shocked by consolidation under $10 before next leg

Why Qualcomm’s Latest Price Target Can’t Be Ignored,"As we head into the final week of June, **Qualcomm** continues to test investors’ patience. Even with a fundamentally solid earnings report in April and a tidy 25% gains since then, the tech giant is failing to ignite the kind of sustained uptrend seen in bigger peers like **NVIDIA** or **Broadcom**. Shares have been drifting downwards for nearly two weeks, though Monday’s 1% gain showed some welcome strength. The uptrend that began in April is technically still intact, but only just.

This lack of momentum has been especially frustrating given Qualcomm’s healthy diversification across handsets, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT), not to mention its recent M&A activity.

And yet, analyst coverage has been sparse in comparison to other major chipmakers. That’s why last week’s update from Bank of America can’t be ignored.

# Bank of America Sees at Least 30% Upside

Bank of America’s research team, led by Tal Liani,reiterated its Buy rating on Qualcomm, though it trimmed its price target from $245 to $200. It’s a noteworthy move, while they’ve tempered expectations, they still see roughly 30% upside from where the stock closed on Monday.

Their reasoning was clear. As we mentioned above, Qualcomm’s Q2 earnings were solid, with the numbers coming in ahead of analyst expectations pretty much across the board. Its QCT segment, which includes the company’s core chip business, and its Handsets did especially well, while Automotive and IOT were both impressive too.

# Potential Headwinds for Qualcomm

The problem, though, according to Bank of America, is that some of its sales trends are showing signs of stagnation. As **Apple** , one of Qualcomm’s key customers, continues to bring more and more of its manufacturing in-house, Bank of America now expects its contribution to headset sales to fall sharply and potentially disappear altogether. That’s a huge headwind for a company still heavily dependent on smartphone cycles.

Still, they believe Qualcomm’s AI PCs and data center growth can offset some of the drag, though the company is lacking any near-term catalysts that could spark renewed bullishness. All that being said, however, their updated $200 target reflects a 15x multiple on their 2026 earnings estimate, which keeps Qualcomm looking extremely cheap relative to the sector. The stock’s current forward P/E sits below 14, in stark contrast to NVIDIA’s 46.

These risks aren’t new, but taken together, they help explain why the stock has struggled to build lasting momentum. The Bank of America team could easily have downgraded the stock to a Hold, but they didn’t, and investors should take confidence from that.

And with the stock trading at a highly unusual discount to its peers from a valuation standpoint, you can’t help but feel there’s a bargain to be had here - you might just have to wait a little longer than is ideal for the payoff.

# Watch the Chart

From a technical standpoint, Qualcomm is approaching an inflection point. Last week’s update would have helped spur some bullish interest, but the stock has been effectively trending down for the past fortnight. Crucially, the MACD just completed a bearish crossover, and momentum could turn negative if shares don’t start rallying north soon.

Given the S&P 500 index is on the verge of an all-time record close, bulls will want to see Qualcomm move back towards $160 this week, which would mean it avoids setting a lower low and risking a breakdown of the uptrend.

As AI and edge computing continue to drive long-term demand, stocks like QCOM, AVGO, MAAS, MSFT, MU, and TXN could benefit from renewed infrastructure and device-side innovation, especially in areas like IoT and automotive connectivity.

For investors willing to stomach some near-term volatility, Qualcomm offers an intriguing mix of value, optionality, and a long-term AI tailwind. The latest analyst commentary should serve as a reminder that while the potential mightn’t be as bright as some others out there, it’s far from lost. But unless shares can shake off the lethargy and recapture momentum soon, it may take another upside surprise to get the stock firing again.",1750850059.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lk2wb3/why_qualcomms_latest_price_target_cant_be_ignored/,stocks

"RobinHood feels rigged: Missed gains, broken alerts, and useless restrictions","Honestly, sometimes it feels like they’re making it harder on purpose just so you don’t cash out. My price alerts don't always work. I’ll have alerts set for certain stocks, but half the time I don’t even get notified when they hit the price. A bunch of my friends have had the same issue. The alert system is just super unreliable.

And don’t even get me started on the trading hours. Compared to Webull, it’s a joke. You can’t trade before 7am, but a lot of the real moves happen between 4am and 7am. I’ve missed so many runs where a stock was up 200% pre-market, but by the time 7am rolls around it’s already tanked. It honestly feels like they’re limiting access to benefit themselves or whoever’s behind the scenes.

Yeah, sure, the app looks nice and it’s pretty easy to use. But for anyone who’s actually trading seriously, it’s a complete letdown.

"Eutelsat opens new station in Angola, advancing its digitalization goals","Completion of the structure could serve as an economic multiplier for the region through reliable connectivity services

The Eutelsat Group has inaugurated a new satellite ground station in the Luanda-Bengo Special Economic Zone (EEZ) (Angola).

Eutelsat has an excellent reputation in Angola as a provider of geostationary satellite communications services and is looking to further expand its investment in the country. The company said the new ground station will carry its OneWeb low-Earth orbit (LEO) network to Angola and the wider Central African region.

“This ground station represents another step in the transformation of digital inclusion in Africa,” said Eutelsat-OneWeb Regional Director. “It underscores our commitment to bridging the connectivity gap and supporting the continent’s socio-economic development.”

Investment in the Luanda-Bengo ground station amounts to $15 million (R$82.7 million) in capital expenditure, with ongoing operating costs expected to reach $5 million (R$27.5 million) over the next decade, as part of a multi-year agreement with pan-African construction company Paratus Group. The station will contribute to the digitalization of public services such as schools, hospitals and government buildings.

Eutelsat celebrated the milestone as a step towards bridging the digital divide and driving inclusive economic growth. The station is the latest of several Eutelsat stations on the continent, along with other installations located in Mauritius, South Africa, Tanzania, Senegal and Ghana.

“The issuance of this license represents a monumental step forward in our mission to transform telecommunications,” said Amr Ashour, Senior Market Access Manager, Middle East and Africa, Eutelsat-OneWeb. “These state-of-the-art facilities will significantly improve connectivity, optimize data transmission and deliver significant benefits to metropolitan and rural areas across the African continent. We are honored to celebrate this milestone and look forward to an innovative future.”

Eutelsat is set to spin off its ground station infrastructure into a separate company after signing an $831 million sale and leaseback agreement with EQT late last year.

It is worth noting that Brazil has sought to increase and diversify its trade relations with Angola. After two terms in office in which trade between the countries was practically frozen, the Brazilian and Angolan governments intend to create opportunities beyond oil and agribusiness, the main pillars of joint business. In February 2023, Brazil and Angola signed cooperation agreements in areas such as tourism, education, health, agriculture, and exports. President Lula also inaugurated the Ovídio de Andrade Melo gallery in Luanda, a cultural center linked to the Itamaraty dedicated to Brazilian and Angolan art and culture. In addition, Brazil inaugurated the Consulate General of Brazil in Luanda, the country's capital, in February 2025, the country's only consulate general in Africa. Angola is home to the largest community of Brazilians in Africa, with approximately 30,000 people.

Don’t fall for the doom and gloom: We aren’t close to a recession right now,"Recession generally happens and is defined as negative gdp for multiple quarters + a bad labor market. There are no indicators we have a bad labor market at the moment or on the horizon and it's highly probable gdp will be positive this quarter after a bad q1.

Federal reserve most likely will cut rates in fall which will stimulate the economy which is a good indicator that gdp won't drop significantly.

US Prepares Action Targeting Allies’ Chip Plants in China (WSJ),"By Liza Lin, Amrith Ramkumar and Raffaele Huang

(Wall Street Journal) -- A U.S. official told top global semiconductor makers he wanted to revoke waivers they have used to access American technology in China, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could inflame trade tensions.

Currently, South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing enjoy blanket waivers that allow them to ship American chip-making equipment to their factories in China without applying for a separate license each time.

Jeffrey Kessler, head of the unit in charge of export controls at the Commerce Department, told the three companies this week he wanted to cancel those waivers, according to people familiar with the meetings. They said Kessler described the action as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on critical U.S. technology going to China.

If carried out, the move could be disruptive both diplomatically and economically. Earlier this month, the U.S. and China agreed to a fragile trade truce in London. Part of the deal involved each country agreeing to hold off from introducing new export controls and other measures designed to hurt the other.

The action isn't a new trade escalation but would be designed to make the licensing system for chip equipment similar to what China has in place for rare-earth materials, White House officials said. The U.S. and China continue to make progress on completing the agreement they reached in London and negotiating on trade, they said.

""Chip makers will still be able to operate in China. The new enforcement mechanisms on chips mirror licensing requirements that apply to other semiconductor companies that export to China and ensure the United States has an equal and reciprocal process,"" a Commerce Department spokesman said.

A new step making it harder for global chip makers to operate in China might still strike Beijing as a betrayal of the London deal. It could also strain the relationship between Washington and friendly governments in South Korea and Taiwan, whose companies would be most affected and have promised large investments in the U.S. in recent years.

The Chinese factories in question -- including a Samsung memory-chip factory in the Chinese city of Xi'an -- are part of the global supply chain for memory, logic and other chips. While they generally don't have the most advanced technology, the factories' output is widely used in cars, consumer electronics and the like.

Industry officials said tighter curbs by Washington wouldn't immediately force the factories to shut down, but over time, they could find it harder to operate effectively. That would disrupt global industry as companies are dealing with other issues triggered by the U.S.-China trade war, such as China's limits on exports of rare-earth magnets.

The chip makers would likely seek case-by-case licenses from the U.S. government to supply their Chinese factories, while looking to replace U.S. equipment with alternatives from Japan and Europe.

People involved in the discussions said revoking the waivers isn't a done deal.

They said Kessler's unit -- the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security -- hasn't secured buy-in from other parts of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Department. Opponents in the administration worry eliminating the waivers would ultimately end up boosting Chinese companies and give China control of the plants.

Kessler and other national-security hawks have taken a hard line on cutting off China from American technologies, arguing that aggressive measures are needed to limit the country's advances in critical sectors and spur development of supply chains outside China. Those efforts have put them in conflict with pro-business officials.

In recent weeks, the administration has halted sales to China of more high-end chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. That has dented the U.S. companies' revenue by billions of dollars. Commerce also weighed broad restrictions on sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, although a White House official said that move was no longer under consideration.

The South Korean and Taiwanese companies have notified authorities in their home regions about the waiver issue, hoping for help lobbying against the move, people familiar with the discussions said.

Both South Korea and Taiwan are negotiating broader trade deals with Washington, part of a wave of agreements the Trump administration hopes to wrap up in the coming weeks.

The companies see their Chinese factories as important for competing against Chinese rivals, which are looking to win more global business as chip suppliers. Samsung's current U.S. waiver has allowed its Xi'an plant to make some advanced products that compete against China's Yangtze Memory Technologies, among others.

South Korea, a U.S. military ally, and Taiwan have worked with the U.S. in its technology race with China, including by limiting transfer of advanced technology to China. TSMC, Samsung and SK Hynix have all made multibillion-dollar investments in U.S. factories with backing from Washington.",1750431289.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lg60qm/us_prepares_action_targeting_allies_chip_plants/,stocks

Could SunPower (SPWRQ) trading be re-enabled with it's bankrupt restricting/rebranding?,"Title should say: ***bankruptcy restructuring***/rebranding

I, along with quite a few others, weren't paying day-to-day attention to the solar panel company SunPower when it filed for bankruptcy in August of last year, and weren't able to dump our SPWRQ stock before it flatlined: https://i.imgur.com/mx6KJ2J.png and became untrade in bokerages: https://i.imgur.com/ea4Z0VL.png since then

For whatever reason(s), I couldn't close the position and remove it from my portfolio, but I'll be the first to admit I know little to nothing about chapter 11 bankruptcy law and it's interaction with stock markets.

However, I just came across some news articles that after SunPower sold its assets to Complete Solaria, Complete Solaria is actually reviving and rebrand to the old SunPower name: https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2025/04/23/sunpower-rises-again/. Although the articles states ""The company’s ticker symbol will change from “CSLR” and “CSLRW” to “SPWR” and “SPWRW”, respectively, effective April 22, 2025"" the SPWR symbol still seems to be going: https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SPWR:NASDAQ

Also SunPower has regained Nasdaq compliance, reporting Q1 profits, being it's first profitable quarter in three years, and to returning solar panel and installation sales: https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/05/06/sunpower-regains-nasdaq-compliance-reports-q1-profit/.

With this news, could Robinhood or other brokerages reactivate the SunPower trading? Once all the Nasdaq re-filling kinks are worked out. Those lingering $0.0001 shares look a bit out in my portfolio, lol.

I also found this trading symbol change notice in https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=55054  that *""SunPower Corporation (SPWR) will change its trading symbol to SPWRQ effective August 16, 2024, dueto the listing of the company on an OTC market. As a result, option symbol SPWR will change to SPWRQ effective at the opening of business on August 16, 2024.""* Again, August 2024 has come and gone and the SPWRQ stock hasn't budged.

However, one redditor stated: ""Equity owners (shareholders) are typically wiped out in bankruptcies. All the asset sales are going to the creditors."" - https://www.reddit.com/r/SunPower/comments/1g6mo5r/what_to_do_with_sunpower_stock/lskcr2p/

Ok, fair enough, if it's gone, it's gone, built I would like to get some clarity what's going on, if possible. The fact that the ""new"" SPWRQ stock is still $0.0001 means Complete Solaria rebranding/takeover hasn't completed?

However, there is no big dip, but there could still be. Or they could not be. This is getting close to 'timing the market', and I'm more of a 'time in the market' sort of guy.

Hiring Edward Jones Advisor Without Opening Account,"Twice to see an Edward Jones advisor, the guy is amazing, tells me if I'm thinking about things correctly. But, I'll never open an Edward Jones account. Never.

I need his brain now for 30 minutes to give me a nod on a scenario I've been thinking through. Can I hire him as an external advisor to Edward Jones? He'll probably meet with me if I ask, but I feel like I'm abusing his time without any intention of opening up an account.

I want to pay him for his services. I tell him so. But he'll likely still see me for free if I request a meeting because that's probably what Edward Jones wants him to do.

How can I pay him for 30 minutes of his time? Or, is my only option to find an independent advisor who doesn't work for Edward Jones? I really value HIS advice though. I'll pay for his time.

I was looking at some ETFs and mutual funds that my bank offers: they have a good performance roughly a 40+% return over a 10 year period (excl fees). At the same time looking at the USA government bonds I understand that the yield is 4.5% over a year or so, so essentially over a 10-year period a similar performance with a much safer asset.

Using a Solo 401K to do a Mega Backdoor Roth IRA,"I’m in the early conversations of speaking with a CPA about using a solo 401K to set up a mega backdoor roth IRA and I was curious if anyone out here has done this before.

For context, I recently finished college and have started working. I’m in the 24% tax bracket and my CPA and I aren’t too worried about me getting into the 32% bracket. I have one full time job that gives me a W-2 and a contract job that gives me a 1099.

The problem is that my W-2 job won’t allow in service 401K conversions making it not possible to convert it into a roth IRA at least while i’m still working there. I’m hoping that setting up a solo 401K with a company (i.e., vangaurd or fidelity) that allows in service conversions will allow me to contribute and convert more than $7000 a year to my Roth IRA.

My CPA has advised that I also write off as many expenses as I can from my contract job as the self-employment tax is quite high. He also stated that the maximum I can contribute to my solo 401K is only 20% of whatever my net income from the contract job is meaning if I make $20,000 from my contract job a year I can only contribute and then convert $4000 (not taking into account the tax on that $4000). He is not sure if I can take my after-tax money from my W-2 job contribute as an after-tax contribution to my solo 401K. He is under the impression that it can only be the wages gained from my contract job. He was also worried about me maxing out my 401K at my W2 job and contributing to my solo 401K at the same time, but if I’m trying to convert everything in my solo 401K it should be fine?

He’s going to do more research before getting back to me. I was doing research through the White Coat Investor so I believe it is possible. I just want to see if anyone else has done this or has any comments/advice to offer. I hope to cross check what my CPA says when he gets back to me in a couple weeks.

TLDR: Trying to set up a solo 401K to mega backdoor roth IRA because my full time job won’t allow it.

Anyone else here self-taught in managing their own investments after a windfall or inheritance? How’s it going for you?,"Hi all, I’m in my late 20s, working a pretty standard tech job (did a few years in retail before that). Sometime last year, I was fortunate enough to receive a mid to high 5 figure inheritance from family. At first, I let the bank’s advisors handle it, but honestly the returns were pretty underwhelming. So I decided to start learning on the side on my own. Taught myself the basics of investing, lots of youTube, books and lurking on this sub haha.

Fast forward to a year now, and I’ve managed to grow my little inheritance to just over six figures. Nothing crazy, but I’m pretty proud considering I started with zero experience and just learned as I went. I’m still keeping things pretty conservative (mostly index funds, some blue-chip stocks, and a bit of crypto for fun).

My main goal is to save up for a down payment on a property in the next few years, so I’m trying to balance growth with not taking on too much risk.

Curious if anyone else here is in a similar boat, either got a windfall, received an inheritance or just decided to take the DIY route with their investments. How’s it going for you? How long have you been managing your own portfolio, and what’s been your biggest lesson so far?

Would love to hear some stories, tips, or even just cheer each other up about the learning curve, process, etc. Thanks!",1750584703.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lhjxii/anyone_else_here_selftaught_in_managing_their_own/,investing
Investing a substantial forgivable loan - liquidity and tax considerations,"Burner account because obviously.

I have been offered a substantial forgivable loan from a company, and I'm debating how I would invest the proceeds. The loan is $500,000 total, and I would receive that amount at the inception of the loan. 1/5 of the loan would be forgiven each year for the next five years, assuming I'm still employed at the company. The loan has an interest rate that is equal to the lowest interest rate permitted by the IRS for an 5-year term arm's length loan (currently about 4%), and the accrued interest to date would be forgiven each year in the same manner as the corresponding principal amount as described above. Every time a tranche of the loan is forgiven, I have to pay taxes on the forgiven amount at that time, which is taxed as ordinary income.

.

The substantial risk here is that if I leave the company (or am laid off) during the term of the loan, I have to pay back the non-forgiven principal and interest accrued to date within 30 days. So I need to be pretty liquid with the investment. The goal is therefore to meet or beat the 4% interest rate (ideally, post-tax) but maintain at least pretty good liquidity.

.

In the immediate term, my candidate solution is to invest in individual municipal bonds with a maturity date right before the first tranche of the loan is forgiven (in about a year). Current rates on such municipal bonds I'm seeing are roughly 5%, and they are not subject to federal income taxes, which is a substantial perk. When those bonds mature, I would reassess and probably lean towards reinvesting the proceeds in municipal bonds again with about a one year term.

.

There is liquidity risk in that I could be compelled to repay the loan before those municipal bonds mature, but there are three considerations that mitigate this:

(1) I think it's very unlikely I would separate or be separated from the company within the next six months. Probably if I am separated from the company, the most likely time would be as we approach the date of the first tranche being forgiven.

(2) Municipal bonds can be sold on the secondary market, so I could liquidate early if necessary. Granted, if interest rates go up (and that seems likely!), I might have to sell at a loss, but the volatility here is less than the stock market.

(3) I have the capacity to liquidate other stock investments and/or take out short-term loans (e.g. until the bonds mature) to repay the loan if necessary.

.

So, thoughts? Can you come up with a better solution? It's an interesting problem and not one that I've been able to find much about online. Thank you!",1750631305.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1li0iw9/investing_a_substantial_forgivable_loan_liquidity/,investing
401k Plan - Does this even look possible to accomplish?,"I want to make some forecast/projections of how much 401k account can grow and sustain. I know market conditions can change (e.g., market under or overperforms, not contributing the full max, etc.), so not banking that this will be the exact numbers by the time I reach a couple of these milestones.

* **Starting balance**: $395,340.74 (What I've accumulated the last 8.5 - 9 years).
* **Starting salary**: $91,500 (In addition to employer match of 5% and salary base increase of 2% annually)
* **Annual contribution**: $23,500
* **Annual return**: 7%

I'll contribute for 25 years, then let time and returns carry my portfolio through the final 8 years.

|Age|Year-End Balance|Inflation-Adjusted (2.5%)|Inflation-Adjusted (3%)|

|40|**$395,340.74**|**$488,346**|**$448,346**|

|72|**$23,125,326**|**$12,648,090**|**$6,866,508**|

**Summary**:

Just for context: I could adjust this for inflation or make it conservative at even 5%-6%, but the numbers are encouraging IF things stay the way they are. I plan to start Roth conversions in my personal Roth IRA at 60 and hopefully will help minimize large tax bill and remain in a desirable tax bracket by then.

Employer stop contributing to my 401k,"I've been giving the max allowed, 22%. Their agreement doesn't allow me to withdraw my funds while I'm still employed. Although, I can stop contributing. I also don't have a choice and what they invest in. Of course it's not growing very fast, barely keeping up with inflation.

Should I stop contributing and send that money to my taxable brokerage account? I believe there are some protections built into money inside of 401k versus a brokerage account. But I'm 58 years old and I hope to retire in four or five years and I need growth right now.",1750512410.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lgwjn2/employer_stop_contributing_to_my_401k/,investing

Should I add Roth and/or IRA to my portfolio?,"I have more or less these in my family's portfolio:

My question is am I missing anything by not having a Roth or IRA? 

I am paying low interest rates on my mortgage so I basically have minimal deduction from it.  So I'm maxing out as much as I can on contributions to the 457 and 401k to take advantage of the tax deferment.

Is It Actually Moral and Good to Invest In Evil Companies?,"There is an assumption for most people that ethical investing involves not investing in companies that one deems (personally) immoral. The types of companies one deems immoral will be different for every investor, but is not important for this question. Question is: For someone that cares about a certain issue, is it actually *better* to invest in that company, reap the rewards, and then use the rewards for your cause, than to not invest at all?

If You Don't Think AI is Very Bubbly...,"A new startup, founded and led by for OpenAI CTO Mira Murati just raised the largest seed round ever; $2B.  Her company, Thinking Machines Lab, has an estimated valuation of $10B based on the fundraise.

Here's the kicker, Thinking Machine Labs has no product. All it has is a vague stated goal ""to make AI systems more widely understood, customizable, and generally capable"" and a bunch of AI heavy hitters on its founding team. 

It's also a public benefit corporation. So, you know, a ton of money to ""make the world a better place"" with the corporate equivalent of ""a concept of a plan"". Nothing to see here, folks. 

To top it off, the company is structured in such a way Murati's votes on the BOD are weighted to give her majority decision making capability. What could possibly go wrong?

\- No easy substitute (platinum still not a full replacement)

How to find peace with my investment?,"I've always been frustrated with active investing. I've beaten myself up for not making best decisions and it got me very depressed and irritated even though I am kinda profitable. I feel like I have never done enough research about the companies. I am constantly anxious about my portfolio. Which stocks should I hold? How should I manage the position? Therefore, I tried to study on various technical analysis trading strategies and try a lot of algo trading strategies so that I can have a fully mechanic system to make decision. Then I found that it is very difficult to beat s&p 500. Even if I can do it I think it's not worth the effort because the excess return is not that much and I can not guarantee that the system will consistently outperform the market so it's still walking on thin ice and still kind of discrteional because I need to make decisions on adjusting the strategy.

So two year ago I decided that I should just buy and hold the stock market index and get rid of all the stress. But I was not satisfied with 8\~10% return and thought that I could leverage my exposure and made use of this opportunity after a bear market in 2022. It worked great until this april. I grew my account from 80k to 800k in two years (included my salary income). My basic strategy is to hold 3\~4x leverage broad market future and will add more if there is a bit of correction (like 2023/12 and 2024/8). I planned to stop at 2M net worth so with 4x leverage it's another (2M/800k-1)/4\*100%=37.5% and I'll be set. This april I blew up my account because I added on the way down and ended up overleveraged and got margin called. I went from 800k to less than 50k and realized that it's not really a sustainable strategy. Well, deep down I knew it's not sustainable but I wanted to make use of this post-2022 bull market cycle to the fullest because I hate investing so much that I want to make money faster and then sit with 5\~8% return for the rest of my life.

After this incident, I return to steady investment and am considering go back to active investing and trading. Currently I just hold SPY, QQQ, and NVDA. But I find that I beat myself up for taking profits too early or not buying more or not buying any other rallying stock like AVGO, AMD, and a ton of others. I get really mad to the point it affects every aspect of my life. Sometimes I think to myself is it really worth it if investing makes me financially successful but ruin my overall life. I am looking for any suggestion. Much appreciated.

PS. I want to clarify that I am not sharing my story to just rant about my tramatized experience but to explain my thought process and show that I've tried many approaches in investing and that I've always tried very very hard to outperform the market. So I think I need more advice on mindset and psychology rather than ""find a strategy"" or ""just buy and hold spy"" kind of stuff. I am still open to this advice but I need more psychological aspect of it.",1750856639.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lk54co/how_to_find_peace_with_my_investment/,investing
How Do I start? And where? I'm in Taiwan,"Hello everyone!

I'm 30F from the Philippines. I came to Taiwan carrying nothing but emotional pain from growing up with an absent father. I have four younger siblings who are still enduring the same emotional struggles back home, and I really wanted to save them.

Now, I'm determined to use this money wisely. My goal is to prove to myself and my father that I can rise from nothing, and build a future that’s not only stable, but abundant. I want to be rich and give my siblings the financial security they never had. 

I apologize if I shared a bit too much information.

What is your take on an ETF vs. Mutual fund given similar holdings/expense ratio?,"I have these holdings in ROTHs so there is no tax penalty moving them around so I'm always trying to fine tune.   I have multiple brokerage accounts (Fidelity, Schwab, Etrade) and up until now have been holding MFs that each brokerage offered (Due to no load/transaction fees, etc.) but with ETS w/ very similar holdings/returns I have to wonder if the management these ETFs do is any different than the ETF which do also manage their holdings (Sometimes monthly, sometimes quarterly).  I like the benefit of being able to liquidate an asset at any point (Rather than waiting until after close w/ a MF) as well as the fact that I have the funds available to use instantly w/ an ETF sale.  Each of these tracks a different market so I'd be curious on your opinions on that as well. Perhaps it's best to stick w/ what I have diversify what markets are tracked?  If I do this, I need to research international Large blend ETFs but I'd be curious of your opinions on International large blend or growth ETFs w/ low expense ratios (<.04%).

Examples

**Current Schwab  MF holdings:** (Considering moving SWPPX at a minimum to SCHG)   
SWISX    .06%  Tracks the MSCI EAFE Index  
SWPPX   .02%  Tracks the S&P 500 (1/3rd in tech)  
SWLGX   .035% (48% tech ) Tracks the Russel 1000 Growth index

  
**Considering**:  
SCHG  .04% (48% tech and VERY similar top 10 holdings to SWLGX) Tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index vs. Russel 1000 Growth index

  
**Current Fidelity**  
FXAIX .015%  Tracks the S&P 500 (1/3rd in tech)  
FSPGX .035% (47% tech) Tracks the Russel 1000 Growth index

**Considering**:  
SCHG  .04% (48% tech and VERY similar top 10 holdings to SWLGX) Tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index vs. Russel 1000 Growth index

  
So basically I would be moving at least FSPGZ and SWLGX tracking from the Russel 1000 growth index to S&P 500 index.  Not sure if there is any benefit to that aside from the fact I could move the funds much quicker if need be.  I also like the real-time stats I see on an ETF vs. a MF.  Petty and insignificant, I know.

What are the perils of a Reverse stock split,"Okay, so I know penney stocks are pretty much a fools errand. That being said, when I was trying to research a concept I was interested in, the only publicly traded company I could find happened to be on the chopping block on the Nasdaq due to trading below 1.00USD.  

So the question. Does anyone know of a stock that flushed after a reverse split? 

My presumption it that the company does the split to raise the stock price to avoid being delisted then issues new stock at the higher stock price to gain additional funding without the need for loans. The company is pretty old so I don't think that this is some fly by night hoodwink. Just curious as to the community's thoughts. Thanks in advance

Has anyone back tested a strategy of tracking towards goal yearly with any surplus gains going into a steady investment?,"Ik there are back testing tools but not really good with them yet and can’t get to exactly this. Never heard of this so guessing results are not very good but curious what this would look like. 

The parameters are basically this:

You are 30 with a goal of retiring by 67 with a goal of hitting $1M in todays $. You calculate $7000 per year (max IRA, goes up roughly with inflation so easy to track) with 6.5% real return gets you to that goal.

The problem is while 6.5% is pretty average year to year, decade to decade, returns swing pretty wildly and the timing of these swings greatly impact performance even if the return is 6.5% over this time. For example really strong early performance when you don’t have much in with much worse performance later when you have a lot in could in total have 6.5% returns but you’d fall short. 

To manage this the portfolio is reallocated at end of every year to smooth this out and increase certainty the goal is hit. 

For example in year 1 there was 2% inflation. With the target of 6.5% real return the goal should be to have $7k grow to $7,595 plus max ira contribution that hopefully tracked roughly with inflation. The market nominally returned 15% though and portfolio stands at $8050. You are $455 above target. In this scenario you move $455 to safe investment that tracks inflation. 

Continue this over and over. Your portfolio in stocks is on target to hit your goal while having surplus in cash. Whenever downswing hits that takes you under target you move cash to equity til it brings you back to target. Anytime you are short of target with no cash you stay 100% equity.

Leveraging my Roth IRA through Lifecycle Investing | Q2 2025,"**Today, June 24th 2025**

Welcome to the beginning of my controversial investing journey where I use lifecycle investing to incorporate leverage in my Roth IRA. Currently, I am 27 years old, with $15,000 in my Roth IRA. I’ve bought one LEAP on VTI at a 150 strike when VTI traded at 300 which is essentially 2x exposure at half the cost of the underlying. Yes I understand that the timing of this is less than ideal. I’m currently hedging against the market in my trading account but for the purposes of lifecycle investing, timing doesn’t matter. It’s more so about your time in the market. When it comes to this, I want as little of my opinion as possible. I hesitated to do this for a long time because I know that once I start, I can never stop. The worse case scenario would be starting now and going back to the traditional buy and hold strategy after I lose all my money from a market crash. 

Please see below for the current information regarding the trade. Which I will be updating every quarter (every 3 months). 

[https://imgur.com/a/TObhiSK](https://imgur.com/a/TObhiSK)

Performance:

Initial investment (June 2025): $15,611.64

Current investment (June 2025): $15,611.64

Below, I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement.

**What Is Lifecycle Investing?**

Lifecycle investing, by Ayres and Nalebuff, argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth (including future earnings) is much larger than their current savings. Since most young investors have little capital available for investment, but decades of future earnings, they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans. As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal, you should gradually reduce risk.

How to do this:

* First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share.
* Use leverage through either margin, leveraged ETFs, or deep-in-the-money LEAPs
* Reduce leverage over time, shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bonds/real-estate and cash as retirement nears.



**My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation**

With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can’t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I’ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn’t offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF’s trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do). 

**Plan**

* Quarterly Recalculation:

   * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share.
   * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s.

1. De-leverage Schedule:

   * Ages 27–30: Maintain 2x leverage.
   * Ages 30–40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase.
   * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation.
   * Ages 50–59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real-estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches.



**Risk Management and Contingencies**

* Time decay: I’ll monitor the LEAP’s theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage.
* Market extremes: If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence. 
* Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal.



**Summary**

I’m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 27 year old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I’ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years.",1750810687.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ljrhwt/leveraging_my_roth_ira_through_lifecycle/,investing
Do Small Cap ETFs really make sense? Don't we lose the winneres as they grow?,"I've been thinking a lot about small cap ETFs and I have a question. 

These ETFs track indexes of small cap companies, but here's what bugs me:  
When a company starts perfoming well, growing, and gaining market cap, it eventually leaves the small cap index, and as a result, gets removed from the ETF.

So, basically, just when the company starts taking off and delivering serious returns, I no longer hold it in the ETF. It fells like I'm always holding the still small companies, but never really benefitting from the breakout growth stories.

But due to you being boots on the ground engineering you happen to know what they are saying is a lie and let's say you reply to a Twitter post with "" you and I both know our infrastructure is not even close to ready yet"". Obviously beyond getting fired, what happens to somebody directly rebuking the executive team like that in terms of stock movement? Let's say you don't own any stock.

Theory Question: Strike Price for Maximum Profit on OTM Options,"Suppose on Day 0 shares are selling for $100. As a genie, I know that shares will sell for $150 on Day 10.

On Day 0, what is the **strike price** on 10 day DTE options that would **maximize my profit**?

Imagine options with the liquidity of $SPY, and so there is some fair market price.

Is this a question with a single answer, or does it depend on the volatility of the equity and DTE of the option?

reddit is invading india harder than the redcoats,"TL;DR - Reddit switched on machine translation for India on 28 Apr 2025, thereby exposing the world’s second-largest internet market to r/WallStreetBets. The chart above shows how Google is now funneling record numbers of new traffic (and thus new users) to Reddit.

India is a huge country. It doubles U.S. user counts on both YouTube and Facebook. Yet India is less than one-third the size of US users on Reddit. The upside here is thus enormous. If you overlay India’s early search-traffic curve on the launch-to-date growth for France, Spain, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil, India is clearly sprinting past every precedent.

This is still a company growing at more than 100% per year at 40x forward earnings. The Trump administration will continue to deregulate across the board, so I don’t believe their core business model is at risk for at least the next 3 years. Macro liquidity is going higher along with HIMS continuing to be a retail favorite. This is an opportunity to buy a market leader at a significant discount. Could it go lower? Absolutely, but in my mind the likelihood of this stock making significant new highs this year is quite good.

To the Moon! (I’m down $3k overall). Humble Beginnings.,"I saw someone post about HIMs this morning, so I bought in and held for today. I’ll likely sell off tomorrow morning because I don’t trust the market.

Sell ​​all Google,"Lately I've noticed my cash reserves are running a bit low, and the overall US stock market seems to be losing momentum. After some consideration, I decided to pull the trigger and sell all my Google shares today.

I originally bought Google back in October last year at around $160 per share. While the profits weren't huge, I'll take it as a modest win. ",1750708053.0,https://i.redd.it/fmbton19dq8f1.png,wallstreetbets

Telesat - $TSAT - Insider DD and generational opportunity,"**Intro:** 

**-** I work as a personal trainer for a high-net-worth manager in Canada.

\- I sniffed out Telesat when I saw a 650 million grant go out to a company with a $850 million market cap.

\- The TSAT Ceo and our newly elected Prime Minister are buddies, kids play sports together etc etc: [reddit.com/r/canadian/comments/1fhd72w/looks\_like\_our\_new\_trudeauappointed\_economic/](http://reddit.com/r/canadian/comments/1fhd72w/looks_like_our_new_trudeauappointed_economic/)

  
\- I wanted to use this as a talking point to talk smack about our government, which I didn't vote for, but instead I dug into the stock. I gave it to the guy I train. His team did the DD and hired Cormark to do it as well. 

\- The results: there are creditors to please, there is a backlog of customers with deals waiting in the pipeline, the premium product is coming out in 2027. The creditors won't risk hurting to company for the big payday they will get when this new 'national-darling' company makes it big. 

*Disclosure: I am long many shares on June 9th and June 16th. Both on the NYSE and TSX. I have some calls too, will add more later. Up 40% in 2 weeks.*

If a deal is reached with debt holders, which it will, since they're smart because they want their investment back + more; and this company will change the world. Then the price target isn't $28. My source says that everyone in his office is buying with an $84 target in 4 years. That's a 6x, and apes can push it higher.
