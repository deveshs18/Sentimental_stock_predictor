Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Tesla Robotaxi Launch: We Were All Wrong (and VW has one now),"I made a speculative post about how Phony Stark would delay the Robotaxi launch and there were lots of other good guesses on how they would fake it (ala- human in a robot suit tactics). We had things like relays back to HQ to operate them like drones, tail cars, AI (actually Indians), and other ways humans would operate them. Well... It looks like they are going to go through with it and it's even worse than we all thought. They are just going to put a human operator inside the cars! Not kidding...

Source: [https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/](https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/)

I am going to need to see a picture of the passenger side floorboard. If they don't put a physical brake pedal in there like all the drivers ed cars have retrofitted in them, you know the human operator will have something like a game controller or button on them to apply the brakes. Classic Elon and Tesla.

Given that the only people riding in these Roboscams are known Tesler fanboys that were invited because of their past posts on X, I am sure the reviews will be nothing short of fantastic. Here is one I can foresee:

""*I felt perfectly safe riding in the awesome new Tesla Robotaxi! The ride was so smooth. I barely felt the bump when we ran over the little kid getting off the school bus and it didn't delay my trip at all after the AI just kept us going.*""

In other news: VW, without feeling the need to spread propaganda ahead of time, just unveiled their production ID. Buzz AD robotaxi. Yeah. That small car company. And it's awesome.

Along with being an actual purpose design and built robotaxi instead of just a Jerrry-rigged older model, it has three things Tesla doesn't:

1. Nine LiDAR sensors (and five radars- so it doesn't crash into things).
2. Space for actual passengers- a key feature to taxis.
3. Level 4 autonomy.

I love the Tesla fan perspective on LiDAR: ""It's expensive"" and ""It's not needed with an AI-driven 100% vision system"". Yeah right. Let's see it work then. We've only been waiting a decade now. If Tesla can solve all of the world's hardest technological problems and are the world's best at manufacturing (as Elon states), then why can't they design and build their own simple LiDAR sensors for their cars? They can't make a better version of the sensor I can buy online for a few hundred bucks that goes into a golf range finder but they are going to make a humanoid robot? One of those things is really hard to do. The other isn't.

Tesla is so far behind in this space. I can't believe there are still enough gullible people still falling for the narrative to pump the stock. Their own internal analysis said this endeavor would lose money. At this point I think there are only three types of people:

1. Aware.
2. Blind Believers (aka- cult members).
3. Traders that are aware of the believers and make money off the stock because of them.",1750427475.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lg4ifl/tesla_robotaxi_launch_we_were_all_wrong_and_vw/,stocks

US Prepares Action Targeting Allies’ Chip Plants in China (WSJ),"By Liza Lin, Amrith Ramkumar and Raffaele Huang

(Wall Street Journal) -- A U.S. official told top global semiconductor makers he wanted to revoke waivers they have used to access American technology in China, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could inflame trade tensions.

Currently, South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing enjoy blanket waivers that allow them to ship American chip-making equipment to their factories in China without applying for a separate license each time.

Jeffrey Kessler, head of the unit in charge of export controls at the Commerce Department, told the three companies this week he wanted to cancel those waivers, according to people familiar with the meetings. They said Kessler described the action as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on critical U.S. technology going to China.

If carried out, the move could be disruptive both diplomatically and economically. Earlier this month, the U.S. and China agreed to a fragile trade truce in London. Part of the deal involved each country agreeing to hold off from introducing new export controls and other measures designed to hurt the other.

The action isn't a new trade escalation but would be designed to make the licensing system for chip equipment similar to what China has in place for rare-earth materials, White House officials said. The U.S. and China continue to make progress on completing the agreement they reached in London and negotiating on trade, they said.

""Chip makers will still be able to operate in China. The new enforcement mechanisms on chips mirror licensing requirements that apply to other semiconductor companies that export to China and ensure the United States has an equal and reciprocal process,"" a Commerce Department spokesman said.

A new step making it harder for global chip makers to operate in China might still strike Beijing as a betrayal of the London deal. It could also strain the relationship between Washington and friendly governments in South Korea and Taiwan, whose companies would be most affected and have promised large investments in the U.S. in recent years.

The Chinese factories in question -- including a Samsung memory-chip factory in the Chinese city of Xi'an -- are part of the global supply chain for memory, logic and other chips. While they generally don't have the most advanced technology, the factories' output is widely used in cars, consumer electronics and the like.

Industry officials said tighter curbs by Washington wouldn't immediately force the factories to shut down, but over time, they could find it harder to operate effectively. That would disrupt global industry as companies are dealing with other issues triggered by the U.S.-China trade war, such as China's limits on exports of rare-earth magnets.

The chip makers would likely seek case-by-case licenses from the U.S. government to supply their Chinese factories, while looking to replace U.S. equipment with alternatives from Japan and Europe.

People involved in the discussions said revoking the waivers isn't a done deal.

They said Kessler's unit -- the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security -- hasn't secured buy-in from other parts of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Department. Opponents in the administration worry eliminating the waivers would ultimately end up boosting Chinese companies and give China control of the plants.

Kessler and other national-security hawks have taken a hard line on cutting off China from American technologies, arguing that aggressive measures are needed to limit the country's advances in critical sectors and spur development of supply chains outside China. Those efforts have put them in conflict with pro-business officials.

In recent weeks, the administration has halted sales to China of more high-end chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. That has dented the U.S. companies' revenue by billions of dollars. Commerce also weighed broad restrictions on sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, although a White House official said that move was no longer under consideration.

The South Korean and Taiwanese companies have notified authorities in their home regions about the waiver issue, hoping for help lobbying against the move, people familiar with the discussions said.

Both South Korea and Taiwan are negotiating broader trade deals with Washington, part of a wave of agreements the Trump administration hopes to wrap up in the coming weeks.

The companies see their Chinese factories as important for competing against Chinese rivals, which are looking to win more global business as chip suppliers. Samsung's current U.S. waiver has allowed its Xi'an plant to make some advanced products that compete against China's Yangtze Memory Technologies, among others.

South Korea, a U.S. military ally, and Taiwan have worked with the U.S. in its technology race with China, including by limiting transfer of advanced technology to China. TSMC, Samsung and SK Hynix have all made multibillion-dollar investments in U.S. factories with backing from Washington.",1750431289.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lg60qm/us_prepares_action_targeting_allies_chip_plants/,stocks
Portugal PSI up 0.7%  But what really going on with GALP? Undervalued or overhyped?,"Just checked the Portugal market close  PSI20 gained a solid 0.71% with tech financials and telecom leading the charge. BCP Portugal Commercial Bank was the standout +3.6% pushing the index higher alongside Semapa and EDPR. Overall 19 stocks closed up, only 6 down, so broadbased strength for sure.

But then there GALP the perennial hot topic. The energy giant slid 1.6% on the day despite all the buzz about its undervalued status. I keep seeing those AIdriven picks hyping GALP as a sleeper with massive upside  but is that really the case? The stock has been on everyone radar for a while now, and yet it keeps lagging.

I get the logic energy sector volatility longterm transition risks and maybe some pipeline of projects that could pay off. But fundamentals haven’t really caught up and recent oil price softness isn’t helping. Plus the valuation looks stretched when you factor in EU energy policy uncertainty and competitive pressures.

Honestly it feels like GALP is that classic value trap a lot of folks want to believe in but keep getting burned on. The hype around AI models and hidden gems is cool, but I’m skeptical until I see some clear catalysts or actual earnings beats.

Meanwhile the broader PSI market looks healthier  financials and renewable energy names like EDPR are picking up steam which feels more sustainable.

What do you all think? Is GALP a true undervalued gem, or is it just noise riding the energy hype train?",1750436256.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lg83ex/portugal_psi_up_07_but_what_really_going_on_with/,stocks
"Given the state of certification and infrastructure, what is the real future of eVTOL companies like ACHR?","Trying to make sense of the Archer Aviation hype. Not bearish, just genuinely trying to understand where we’re at & what’s realistic

#Narrative

***“Flying taxis will fix urban traffic.”* (2020–2022)**
Cool idea. Sci fi vibes. felt far off though

***“We’ve got real partners.”* (2023–2024)**
United Airlines, Stellantis, and even the U.S. Air Force got involved. Massive $6B preorder backlog. $142M DoD deal. Starting to feel more legit

***“We’re building national infrastructure now.”* (2025)**
White House drops an executive order to fast track eVTOLs. Archer raises $850M the same week. Total liquidity now over $2B. They’re building out vertiports, showing Midnight at the Paris Air Show & prepping for the LA 2028 Olympics as the official air taxi provider

That’s a lot of momentum.

But they’re still pre revenue. FAA certification still in progress. Midnight is beautifully flying but not in service yet but I admit, I do really like how it looks like. 

AG on X earlier said *""The most valuable asset we have is time. If we can replace hour+ drives with 5-10 min flights in cities all over the world, I think a lot of people would sign up for that so the opportunity to scale this industry is quite large""* is kinda  reminds us that regional air mobility may have a strong market in the coming years.


So the core question remains: is this just future hype or a Tesla style setup?

**Here’s what HC Wainwright is projecting:**

~$18M revenue in 2025

$42M in 2026

Over $1B by 2028

They raised Archer’s price target to $18 based on the regulatory momentum & defense applications

If even half of that happens, we’re looking at serious upside. But yeah, high risk, long runway.

"Capital Increase of € 1.35 Billion for Eutelsat , Anchored by the French State and Other Reference Shareholders","€1.35 billion equity capital increase to be executed by year-end to fulfill strategic plan and longer-term ambitions

The European Commission eyes ditching Microsoft Azure for France’s OVHcloud over digital sovereignty fears,"“Discussions are indeed underway”, an OVHcloud spokesperson confirmed after Euractiv sought comment.

**The European Commission is in advanced business negotiations with OVHcloud, the France-based major European cloud service provider, to transition its cloud services away from Microsoft, according to three senior sources with internal knowledge of the matter who spoke to Euractiv on condition of anonymity.**

The infrastructure shift is being driven by a push for European digital sovereignty in the cloud market, following concerns raised by a US executive order that led to the shutdown of Microsoft services for an employee of a European-based institution.

The goal of the move would be to ensure that European institutions have greater control over their digital infrastructure and data – an idea that has been championed by the EuroStack initiative. It is also a blow for US tech behemoth Microsoft, which has been striving to reassure its European customers in the past weeks.

Once the European Commission ""gets its house into order,"" it is expected to set a precedent for national public administrations to direct public procurement funds towards homegrown cloud providers, one source said. The Commission sees itself as a trend setter, they added, aligning with its broader strategy to enhance the EU's digital autonomy and reduce reliance on non-European tech giants.

We understand the Commission has been in discussions with OVHcloud for several weeks. However, an unknown number of other European cloud providers, including Germany's IONOS, France's Scaleway and Italy's Aruba, are also being considered as potential alternatives.

Coinbase Launches Stablecoin Payments Service for E-Commerce,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/coinbase-launches-stablecoin-payments-service-for-e-commerce

> Coinbase Global Inc. is launching a platform designed to make stablecoins a go-to payment method for online transactions, a potentially big leap forward in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies meant to track the US dollar.

> The announcement follows the passage of landmark stablecoin legislation in the US Senate on Tuesday and comes as large retailers have expressed interest in exploring stablecoins for use as payments in online transactions, a roughly $6 trillion industry. Such use of this type of cryptocurrency threatens to circumvent card networks Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. and other online payment services.

> Coinbase Payments is targeting online platforms like Shopify Inc. and eBay Inc., a prized client segment among payment processors since the websites provide distribution to thousands of small-to-medium sized businesses who are often looking for ways to avoid the fees associated with accepting card payments. Today, Coinbase makes most of its money through transaction fees on the exchange’s cryptocurrency trades.

I’m in the U.S.-my company is global and headquartered/publicly traded in Europe.  They are offering U.S. employees a stock purchase program,"Just to start off, I will say that the only stock that I currently own is in my 401(k). I have never owned or traded stocks directly. I am relatively new with this company, but just sat through a webinar about their stock purchase program.  There are two programs, one is essentially a guaranteed return which has a floor and a “performance payment” should the stock lose value. The second is just a straight full risk purchase.  Participants will get a 15% discount off of the reference price and a company match up to a certain amount.  I am inclined to purchase some stock under the guaranteed return program and some stock under the full risk program (we are permitted to do so), but I’m wondering, is it not otherwise possible for an individual in the U.S. to buy stock in a foreign company?  Just curious.  Obviously buying under this program has its advantages in the form of the discount and the match which I would not get just buying on the open market assuming I could even do so.  Finally, we are required to hold it for at least five years – just wondering if this is common, but in any event, I am seeing this as an opportunity to start a stock portfolio so I would not be in a hurry to sell it anyway.",1750359463.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lfiy1q/im_in_the_usmy_company_is_global_and/,stocks

What is the future of OKLO Inc,"Oklo as it is in it's current state feels to me like it's very overvalued, so would it be reasonable to assume that their stock price will come back down to 20s, given they will still be making no profits until 2027 at the minimum. It is still not profitable, and is no where close to deployment as their first deployment is expected to be in 2027. They still have a while to become profitable but their stock price went up almost 40 dollars on sheer hopium from recent news about contracts and government support. If anyone has been following more closely related to OKLO, you're insight would be appreciated.

MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity,"According to the Financial Times Microsoft may terminate ongoing talks to deepen its partnership with OpenAI citing unresolved disputes over governance and future equity structure

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Is MSFT losing strategic leverage here? Or are they just protecting their current ROI？Could this open the door for Google, Amazon, or even Meta to get in bed with OpenAI?How would a fractured OpenAI impact Azure’s AI moat vs AWS and GCP?MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity

Eutelsat and France’s Armed Forces Ministry Reach Landmark Framework Agreement for Low Orbit Satellite Services in the NEXUS Program,"Eutelsat (ISIN: FR0010221234 - Euronext Paris / London Stock Exchange: ETL) and France’s armed forces ministry (Direction générale de l'armement) have today announced a landmark framework agreement on the occasion of the Paris Airshow.

The agreement is the embodiment of the NEXUS (Neo-Espace pour de multiples Usages Sécurisés) program launched by the French Ministry of Defence, which aims to reinforce the current French military space communications model by combining military and civilian resources.

France reaffirms its commitment to the European IRIS² program, which has been supported from the outset since the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2022. However, the urgency of the international situation means that it cannot wait until then.

As the first concrete step in the NEXUS project, the French defense procurement agency (DGA) has reached a 10-year framework agreement, valued at up to €1 billion in expenditure, with Eutelsat, covering the supply of priority-access space resources (notably capacity on Eutelsat’s OneWeb LEO constellation), the hosting of ancillary missions for the French armed forces, and operational and security maintenance. The agreement also covers the upgrading and securing of the constellation for military grade use.

Jean-Francois Fallacher, Chief Executive Officer of Eutelsat commented: “We are honored at the prospect of supporting the French armed forces through this historic agreement, which underscores the crucial role of low earth orbit satellite capacity in responding to the requirements of contemporary operational theaters. Eutelsat today offers the only commercially operated LEO constellation capable of meeting stringent military standards ahead of the deployment of IRIS². It provides global coverage, low latency, rapid deployment, and adaptability to mobile use cases, attributes validated by successful large-scale experiments conducted with the French Armed Forces.”

That moment when your indicator finally signals... after the move is over,"You know that feeling when RSI finally hits ""overbought"" and you short... then watch the stock rip another 20%? Or when MACD crosses bearish after the stock already tanked?

I swear half my losses came from indicators that need a week to tell me what happened yesterday. By the time they ""confirm"" anything, the real money's already been made by someone else.

The whole thing is backwards. These indicators use moving averages - they're literally designed to be slow. Waiting for pivot confirmations, crossing signals, divergence ""proof""... meanwhile the stock's already moved 10%.

I have been working on reading momentum differently. Instead of averaged prices over X periods, just watching the actual fight between buyers and sellers as it happens. Like, are buyers getting exhausted RIGHT NOW, not 5 bars from now.

NVDA at $95 was a perfect example. Every traditional indicator said ""wait for confirmation."" But the real-time action was screaming that sellers were done. Next thing you know it's at $145.

That 52% move? Most of it happened while traditional indicators were still ""waiting for confirmation.""

Same story everywhere - SPX reversals, individual stocks, commodities. The exhaustion shows up immediately if you know what to look for. Not after the fact, not next week, but right when it matters.

"Waymo cars are coming to New York, but with a driver behind the wheel","Residents of New York City will soon start seeing Waymo cars cruising the avenues. But at least for now, a human will be in the driver’s seat.

Alphabet’s self-driving car unit announced on Wednesday that it plans to drive vehicles manually in New York, marking the first step toward potentially cracking the largest U.S. city. Waymo said it applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel in Manhattan.

“While we won’t be in New York full-time yet, we have every intention of bringing our fully autonomous ride-hailing service to the city in the future,” the company said in an announcement. “We’re working towards that goal in a few key ways.”

If the permit is granted, it would be the city’s first testing deployment of autonomous vehicles. New York state law currently prohibits a service like Waymo to operate without a driver.

“We’re advocating for a change in state law that would allow for operating a vehicle with no human behind the wheel,” the company said.

Meanwhile, Waymo is aggressively expanding into new U.S. markets. Waymo One, its ride-hailing service, provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas, and is preparing to bring fully autonomous rides to Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C., in 2026.

Waymo has made a prior appearance in New York.

The company brought its cars to parts of the city in 2021 for manual driving, data collection and testing. Ethan Teicher, a Waymo spokesperson, said “it was a planned trip with a start and an end.” The testing allowed Waymo to improve driving in icy and snowy conditions in a densely populated area, the company said.

Texas Instruments Unleashes $60 Billion Chip Investment Surge,"Texas Instruments *(TXN)* just announced a $60B commitment to expand U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, the largest in its history.

* *""Texas Instruments plans to invest over $60 billion in US to make foundational chips""*  \- Reuters, Bloomberg. 
* Unusual News Volume Factor: 6x its normal. 
* **Stock Reaction: +0.33% today | -0.71% over 5D.** 

News Highlights:  
Texas Instruments (TXN) has announced a sweeping $60 billion commitment to expand its domestic semiconductor operations marking what it calls the largest investment in foundational chip manufacturing in U.S. history.

The investment will fund the construction or expansion of seven chip fabrication plants across three sites in Texas and Utah, including two new facilities in Sherman, TX. The company estimates the initiative will create up to 60,000 jobs across the supply chain and construction ecosystem.

Back in August 2024, TI had outlined a roadmap to build out seven fabs, with projected spending of $40 billion in Sherman and an additional $21 billion across its Utah and other Texas sites. This week's announcement formalizes that vision while slightly increasing the total budget.

The company is aggressively ramping up in-house manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on overseas supply chains and counter the rise of Chinese analog chip competitors. The effort aligns with broader U.S. policy initiatives to reshore critical technology production.

While no detailed timeline was disclosed, Texas Instruments noted that the capital will be allocated over multiple years, with approximately $46 billion earmarked for Texas and $15 billion for Utah. TI emphasized that its long-term capital expenditure plan remains consistent, underscoring a strategic rather than reactive expansion.

Is SPOT overvalued?,"I understand that stocks can keep moving up longer than anyone expects, but I've been watching Spotify for over a year without buying or shorting, just thinking it has to come down. Especially from January to April when SPOT and many stocks seemed to be creating massive head and shoulders, and proceeded to just run and break that potential setup. 

SPOT's market cap is $145b, they were profitable last year for the first time at $1.23b profit from $17b revenue, now with $8.56b cash and cash equivalents on hand, and with debt of $2.27b. 

They have a P/E of 105 and a forward P/E of 67, with their EPS estimates continuously increasing, but they seem to generally miss these targets, last time being by over 50%.

"Why large conflicts, economic changes are not impacting stock markets in last 2 months?","There is something called risk fatigue that has gone into the minds of investors in recent weeks who have become tolerant to large economic shocks (war, fed rates, politics, tariffs etc. ) and are still putting in liquidity that is available. This is also a record stock buyback period which has kept tech stocks stable. AI stocks are a no brainer for many and the second factor to keep tech stocks up and stable. 

The dollar degradation has also caused the USD value of a US traded stock remain stable as USD itself degrades in value. 

The P/E ratios for the broad market are stretched, and yet capital keeps flowing in due to FOMO. It's like standing on what feels like solid ground, but in reality, the sea floor is dropping and no one knows how far down it goes. 

Caution is needed, because the crash may not happen tomorrow, but there is a huge disconnect from fundamentals in this market. The reason bubbles burst and don't just deflate is because reality hits hard.

GD lands $986.8M submarine development contract modification,"WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded General Dynamics Electric Boat a $986.8 million contract modification to support development work tied to the Columbiaclass ballistic missile submarine and related nuclear shipbuilding programs.

The costplusfixedfee award supplements a previously issued contract enhancing design, supply chain and industrial base support across multiple platforms including the Virginiaclass submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers.

$16M in UK funding supports the Common Missile Compartment effort between the U.S. and UK.

Completion projected by December 2031

Majority funding from the FY25 National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund ($794.1M).

Oversight by NAVSEA Naval Sea Systems Command in D.C

The deal aligns with Pentagon and Navy strategic guidance for submarine force recapitalization, addressing capacity constraints identified in a recent FY25 industrial base study.

With rising global maritime threats and mounting pressure on U.S. shipyards GD remains a key pillar in sustaining undersea dominance  but execution risk and industry labor challenges persist.

Palantir's little hardware bro Voyager Technologies (VOYG) and the Golden Dome,"Palantir is like 95% software and 5% hardware and Voyager (a **strategic partner with headquarters on the same street somewhere in Colorado**) is the opposite - it makes a bunch of space/national security stuff.

They might be a ying and yang to the defense game of the future, think two sides of the same coin.

Now:

If Voyager captures just 1.5% of the initial phase of the Golden Dome budget ($25 billion expected in 2026), its annual revenue that year would increase by approximately 2.5x compared to 2024.

And with $150 billion still to be spent by January 2029 to make the Dome operational, capturing 1.5% of that amount would generate **revenue close to Voyager’s current market cap.**

Also: ""This month, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Golden Dome could cost as much as **$831 billion over two decades**"".

Currently maxing out target date fund. Anything else I should be doing?,"Hello, I am currently maxing out my 403b by investing in the vanguard target date fund, and my Roth IRA. My work also offers a 457b account which I am considering maxing out from next year onwards once I have a decent emergency fund saved up this year. This would be a total of ~$47,000 in pretax investments per year. What I worry about is that this doesn’t leave me much to invest on my own. But I feel investing pretax and decreasing my AGI by doing so is a better way to go about this. Is there anything else I should be doing? All advice is appreciated. Thank you.

Should I sell half of my AMD shares and invest the money in Nvidia stock?,"I've been pretty consistently buying AMD shares for the past 5 years. I now have almost $50K invested into the stock, and I'm currently up by around 20%, but this is a pretty disappointing result compared to if I'd invested the same amount into Nvidia 5 years ago. I've so far been very stubborn and just continued to DCA into AMD despite Nvidia performing so much better. I think I was just trying to root for the underdog and hope that AMD would catch up to Nvidia and then their stock would skyrocket. But it's pretty clear now that that isn't going to happen. Would it be a good idea to sell half of my AMD shares and reinvest the proceeds into Nvidia stock to diversify? That way, if Nvidia continues to pop off, I will be able to enjoy some profit from that instead of continuously feeling disappointed that AMD is underperforming.

"Fed announces meeting to discuss easing capital rule, boosting banks' monetary power.","**Loosening of the supplementary leverage ratio would significantly increase the monetary power of banks.**

* US regulators are considering changes to a key capital rule for major banks
* The U.S. central bank announced the board meeting, scheduled for June 25, to discuss changes to the so-called ""supplementary leverage ratio,"" which requires banks to set aside capital against assets regardless of their risk.e Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are reviewing adjustments to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio that applies to the largest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.
* Under the proposal, the capital requirement for bank holding companies could be reduced to a range of 3.5% to 4.5%, down from the current 5%. The banks' operating subsidiaries would likely see their requirements fall to the same range, compared to the existing 6%.
* Banks say the current requirements are excessive and poorly calibrated, and some of that cash could better serve the economy by being lent out.
* They point to how big banks weathered the COVID-19 pandemic and their role in stabilizing regional banks during turmoil in 2023 as proof that they are resilient and do not need to tolerate more onerous rules.
* Among the industry's goals are to lock in a much weaker version of the ""Basel Endgame"" capital rule[,](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-is-basel-iii-endgame-why-are-banks-worked-up-about-it-2023-07-24/) reduce a capital surcharge levied on global banks, re-work a key leverage constraint, and overhaul the Federal Reserve's annual ""stress tests"" which assess whether a bank could withstand an economic shock, said three executives with knowledge of the ambitious lobbying plan.
* If adopted, the changes would represent a significant loosening of post-2008 financial crisis rules designed to ensure banks can absorb losses and remain solvent during periods of market stress. ",1750250381.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1leg1ix/fed_announces_meeting_to_discuss_easing_capital/,stocks

Gene-Editing Stocks Gain on LLY-VERV Deal Announcement,"Eli Lilly’s recent announcement to acquire Verve Therapeutics, Inc, a Boston-based clinical-stage company developing genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease, has put the spotlight on other promising companies developing gene therapies.

Post this acquisition, Lilly will add Verve’s pipeline of gene therapies targeting heart diseases. This includes VERVE-102, an investigational in vivo gene-editing therapy aimed at reducing cholesterol levels.

The share price of other gene-editing companies like Crispr Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics rallied following the announcement. Other companies in this space like Beam Therapeutics were also up. However, share price of Editas Medicine pared most of the gains recorded during the day and ended the session in red.

A Look at Promising Gene-Editing Companies

The rapid evolution of genomics, the study of genes and their functions in recent times has paved the way for a revolutionary era in genetic medicine.

Gene-editing companies hold potential to treat and cure diseases caused by genetic variants. As the name suggests, they make changes or correct defects in the organism's DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a breakthrough in the development of genome editing approaches.

Shares of NTLA were up 6.9% on June 17 on investor optimism about its prospects. Intellia Therapeutics is a clinical-stage gene editing company, focused on developing drugs with CRISPR-based therapies. NTLA is leveraging its modular platform to advance in vivo and ex vivo therapies for diseases with high unmet need.

NTLA’s leads in vivo product candidates are nex-z for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and NTLA-2002 for the treatment of hereditary angioedema.

CRISPR Therapeutics is rapidly leveraging its CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform to develop therapies for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies, cancer, diabetes and other diseases. Shares of CRSP were up 3.9% on June 17. CRISPR Therapeutics achieved a milestone in November 2023, when it received the first-ever authorization/approval for a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy under the trade name Casgevy. CRSP has collaborated with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals for Casgevy.

Meanwhile, BEAM is advancing a broad, diversified portfolio of base editing programs against distinct, genetically validated editing targets.  The company is currently developing BEAM-101 for sickle cell disease (SCD). The FDA recently granted orphan drug designation to BEAM-101 for SCD.

Editas Medicine is a clinical-stage genome editing biotech developing treatment using its proprietary genome editing platform based on the unique CRISPR technology. The company is currently focusing on in vivo (within the living organism) pipeline development.

Focus on M&A in 2025

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) have picked up significant pace in 2025 in the pharma/biotech sector after a passive run in 2024. The recent spree of acquisitions signifies a focus on portfolio expansion and constant pipeline innovation amid the recent tariff threat.

While oncology and immuno-oncology companies have always been at the top of acquisition targets, the lucrative obesity sector and gene-editing space are also being eyed.

Pharma giant Sanofi recently announced that it will acquire Blueprint Medicines for a total deal value of up to $9.5 billion to expand its portfolio in rare immunological disease and add an early-stage pipeline in immunology. The impending acquisition will add Blueprint Medicines’ only marketed product, Ayvakit (avapritinib), an inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA proteins, to Sanofi’s commercial portfolio.

In April, pharma giant Johnson & Johnson acquired Intra-Cellular Therapies for approximately $14.6 billion and added antidepressant drug, Caplyta, to its neuroscience portfolio.

Swiss pharma bigwig Novartis, too, has been on an acquisition spree.  Novartis is all set to acquire San Diego-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Regulus Therapeutics to strengthen its renal disease portfolio.

As M&A momentum accelerates across the gene-editing and biotech landscape, stocks like CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, BGM, EXEL, and ARWR may stand to benefit from renewed investor interest and potential strategic partnerships.

M&A activity is expected to accelerate further in 2025, given the massive cash reserve owned by major pharma and biotech companies and intensifying pressure from investors to diversify business.",1750286721.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1leuykb/geneediting_stocks_gain_on_llyverv_deal/,stocks

"Meta to release smart glasses with Oakley and Prada, extending Luxottica partnership","Meta and EssilorLuxottica plan to release versions of their AI-powered smart glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands, CNBC has learned.

The addition of Prada and Oakley underscore the breakout success Meta had with its second-generation Ray-Ban glasses released in partnership with Luxottica in 2023. The Oakley expansion will be done in partnership with Luxottica, while the addition of Prada signifies Meta’s first step toward bring its wearable hardware to more fashion companies. 

Meta on Monday teased the Oakley release on social media, launching an Instagram account for “Oakley | Meta” with a profile description that reads “The next evolution is coming on June 20.”

CNBC reviewed a document that says the new glasses with Luxottica will be aimed at athletes. Meta is targeting active consumers after seeing several owners of its Ray-Ban glasses use the device to record themselves playing tennis, skiing and doing other activities.

The Oakley version of the glasses may cost around $360 as they are more weather resistant than their Ray-Ban counterparts, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the upcoming device. The first version of the Oakley Meta glasses will feature similar technology to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses released in 2023.

Luxottica, based in France and Italy, has licensing arrangements with over 150 brands and owns notable brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.

Meta’s agreement with Prada comes after the fashion company in December renewed an eyewear-related licensing agreement with Luxottica for 10 years. That deals covers the “development, production and worldwide distribution of eyewear under the Prada, Prada Linea Rossa and Miu Miu brands,” the companies said at the time.

Besides giving Meta a high-end partnership, the Prada glasses may be a particularly good fit for the tech company as many of the brand’s models come with thick temples, former Meta employees said. That provides more heft for housing many of the components necessary for smart glasses, including microphones and chips.

It’s unclear when the Prada deal and product line will be announced.

Meta first partnered with EssilorLuxottica in 2019 to jointly develop the Ray-Ban glasses. The two companies released the first version in 2021, but they found success after the release of the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses in 2023. That version comes equipped with the Meta AI voice assistant and includes features and, when tethered to a smartphone, lets users identify city landmarks, get recipes when looking at ingredients and record and send voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger.

EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February the companies have sold 2 million pairs of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses since 2023. Miller said he aimed to increase annual production to 10 million units by the end of 2026.

Meta and Luxottica announced an extension of their partnership in October, with plans to release more versions of their Ray-Ban glasses. That deal was worth $5 billion, according to a July 2024 report in The Wall Street Journal. As part of the deal, Meta gets exclusive rights to Luxottica’s brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. 

The two companies plan to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC has previously reported.

Competition in the market is heating up.

Last month, Alphabet announced a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker that will see the two companies team up to release glasses infused with Google’s Gemini AI assistant. The companies plan to release the glasses sometime after 2025. 

Snap, meanwhile, announced in June that it plans to release its sixth generation smart glasses under a new brand called Specs. Those glasses, expected for release in 2026, will include augmented-reality technology and will be smaller and lighter than Snap’s prior products, Snap said. 

Meta declined to comment. Luxottica and Prada could not be reached.

Bloomberg News first reported about the Oakley Meta glasses in January.

From Decentralized Hype to Centralized Risk: The Stablecoin Trap,"
The new stablecoin legislation that was pushed through the Senate this week effectively ties the U.S. Treasury to crypto, because nothing says “sound fiscal footing” like betting the government’s cash flow on digital tokens and market hype. 

This new plan forces stablecoins to be backed by short-term T-bills. That creates an estimated $2–$3 trillion in new demand for government debt, which is nearly half the current size of the T-bill market. On paper, that looks like a win. In reality, it’s a circular feedback loop: Crypto demand fuels stablecoins, stablecoins buy T-bills, T-bills fund deficits. The government becomes addicted to speculative capital flows. And round and round we go.

It’ll work great, until it doesn’t. The whole setup depends on risk appetite staying high. Thing is, crypto isn’t some stable, predictable pillar of the economy. It’s a sentiment-driven casino, where whales move markets and retail euphoria inflates bubbles. Confidence in that environment can evaporate overnight.

When the music stops, we will see a wave of stablecoin redemptions. To meet those redemptions, issuers have to dump T-bills into the open market. Yields will then spike and liquidity will dry up. Government borrowing costs jump at exactly the worst time. Suddenly, the entire short end of the Treasury curve is caught in a feedback loop running in reverse.

Crypto is becoming exactly what it claimed to replace: a systemic risk the government can’t afford to let fail. And it won’t be the VC whales or offshore exchanges who foot the bill. It’ll be the taxpayers, either directly or through backdoor rescues and Fed liquidity if things unravel.

Once you tie public finance to crypto flows, the line between a market correction and a fiscal crisis starts to blur. A major stablecoin unwind won’t just hit DeFi yield chasers, it’ll slam the short end of the Treasury market. That’s when the Fed and Treasury will have no choice but to step in, to stabilize yields, backstop liquidity, and calm foreign holders.

So yeah, we’re already halfway to a too-big-to-fail bailout economy for crypto. Not because it earned that privilege, but because we let it entangle itself in the core plumbing of the financial system.

This isn’t just risky, it’s desperate. You don’t latch public finances to speculative manias unless you’re out of conventional tools. And if your fiscal strategy depends on token demand holding up, you’ve already lost the plot.

What makes this even more dangerous is the moral hazard baked in. We’re handing fiscal stability to unregulated private actors, namely stablecoin issuers, hedge funds, and crypto exchanges, many of whom have no oversight and no skin in the game if it blows up. Just like the shadow banks in 2008, they profit on the way up and vanish when the tide goes out.

They’re calling this “financial innovation,” and anyone who questions it a Luddite. But let’s be clear: this isn’t modernization. It’s monetizing the mania and papering over structural deficits by plugging them into whatever speculative engine happens to be hot this cycle.

If this goes sideways, and history says it eventually will, it won’t just hurt crypto. It could shake global trust in U.S. debt markets, and by extension, the dollar itself. Because now our “risk-free” assets are being propped up by the same forces that gave us meme coins and NFT rug pulls. That’s how systems collapse, not with one catastrophic decision, but with a series of reckless bets made under the illusion that the good times will last forever.",1750342239.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lfbs8t/from_decentralized_hype_to_centralized_risk_the/,investing
Looking for Fundamental Analysts to Collaborate on Short-Only Research,"Hey everyone,

I'm working on a short-only equity research project and looking for other fundamental analysts who like digging through financials and spotting red flags.

The focus is on:

* Finding weak companies using things like earnings quality issues, margin decline or aggressive accounting
* Building a screen or framework to surface potential shorts
* Keeping it simple and fundamentals-driven, no machine learning or black-box stuff

Looking to team up with people who:

* Enjoy forensic-style research and digging into 10-Ks
* Have a good nose for trouble in the numbers
* Might already have ideas or experience with short setups
* Are up for bouncing ideas around and working together informally

Not expecting any big time commitment, just hoping to connect with a few like-minded people who take this seriously.

How do long term capital gains income tax brackets work?,"Iv seen the brackets and this seems simple enough but there seems to be some loopholes and I’m not sure how they are handled.

I had a taxable account in college because I did not earn enough to pay capital gains taxes. The plan was to invest in that, sell right before I got a job incurring no taxes and just reinvest. I ended up having to use the money so not sure if this would have worked. 

As far as I can tell an even bigger loophole if you have a lot in a taxable account is just to take 1 year off work, earn no income or just below the threshold, cash out and with income below the threshold pay no taxes on the gains? 

This also seems like a loophole with retirement making a taxable account functionally a Roth IRA? Could you not just in your first year of retirement with 0 income to report, withdraw all the money from your taxable account tax free?

Anyone here investing in land? Curious about long-term potential,"I’ve been exploring land as a long-term investment and recently started looking through Mossy Oak Properties to get a feel for what’s out there. There’s a surprising range depending on location and land use, some geared toward recreation, others with development or timber value.

Then there’s a 20-acre property in Georgia around $95K that’s already cleared and has road access, which feels like a safer hold. They also had a 300+ acre hunting tract in Mississippi for over $800K, which is way out of my budget but interesting from a land portfolio angle.

Thoughts on investment strategy,"Hi everyone, 

I'm 39/m, living in Europe, with inherited US dollars in a Schwab international account, so I cannot invest in mutual funds or ETFs, only individual stocks and bonds. Initially I bought multiple US treasuries with various maturity dates from 2025-2032, just to avoid having to think about it. Then, about a year ago, I started investing 750$/month in 15 individual stocks via Schwab's ""stock slices"" service (so 50$ per stock per month), thus slowly increasing the stocks percentage as bonds start maturing and freeing cash. Since I can't just buy a S&P500-ETF, my idea was to represent it with these 15 stocks, focusing mostly on growth/tech, with a few defensive dividend positions as well, and avoiding big finance, fossile energy and defense industry (just personal preference). I'd be curious to hear what people think of my picks: 

Apple / Microsoft / Nvidia / Broadcom / Adobe / PaloAlto Networks / ServiceNow / Merck / Abbvie / Vertex Pharmaceuticals / Procter&Gamble / NextEra Energy / MainStreet Capital / Realty Income REIT / WasteManagement 

I realize scientifically speaking ""time in the market beats timing the market"", but I just feel more comfortable psychologically with the approach of slowly building the stock portion, as opposed to just buying lump sums of all these stocks at one random moment.

Splitting investments between VOO and SPY,"I understand that these are backed by the same assets, have high volume, and market makers will make sure the value stays very close to what it should be.

I also understand that SPY has a bit larger expense ratio but as the percentage of net worth the difference is tiny.  For a $1 mission account that comes to $945 for SPY and $300 for VOO.

My thinking is that the risk that there is some type of fraud is very very close to zero but not zero.

Tell me why it wouldn't make sense to protect myself from that very unlikely scenario if the cost of doing so is so little?

On a $1 million account with half in SPY and half in VOO, the difference in cost vs all being in VOO is a little over $300 on a $1 million account.  I would pay that for a little piece of mind.  (Also, people buy SPY so clearly the cost is not a big factor to many.)

More generally, I’ve been thinking-- Even if a business / stock has a great 5-10 year outlook, it might become obsolete in 20-30 years. Of course, you could sell the stock when the outlook turns negative, but then you're paying CG taxes (i.e., it's no longer a long-term / retirement investment). 

So my question is: How do you take into consideration the loooong-term / ""end-life” of a stock when investing for retirement? Do you only include stocks that seem “timeless” in your retirement portfolio? Or do you just diversify enough to hedge against a few stocks losing the bulk of their value at some point in the long-term? Or do you just assume that you’ll sell a stock before the downturn, eat the CG tax, and move it into another stock with a solid 5-10 year outlook? 

P.S. this is specifically regarding individual stocks, not ETFs or mutual funds.",1750258560.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lej821/how_do_you_factor_a_stocks_end_life_into_your/,investing

Verve Therapeutics Stock Rockets 75% Pre-Market After Eli Lilly Agrees To Acquire The Company For Up To $1.3B: Retail Says Offer Is ‘Low’,"Lilly will acquire all outstanding shares of Verve for $10.50 per share in cash payable at closing, in addition to a contingent value right (CVR) per share that entitles holders to $3 per share, subject to the completion of certain milestones.

Shares of Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (VERV) rocketed 75% in pre-market on Tuesday after Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) announced its intent to acquire the company for up to $1.3 billion.

Verve is developing gene editing medicines designed to address the drivers of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as low-density lipoproteins, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a), through treatments that may only need to be given once in a lifetime.

Under the terms of the deal, Lilly will acquire all outstanding shares of Verve for $10.50 per share in cash payable at closing, in addition to a contingent value right (CVR) per share that entitles holders to $3 per share, subject to the completion of certain milestones. The aggregate value of the deal is approximately $1.3 billion.

With large-cap names like LLY making bold moves in gene editing, stocks like CRSP, NTLA, BEAM, BGM, ARWR, and EXEL could see renewed attention as investors look for broader exposure across the precision medicine space.

The upfront purchase price of $10.50 represents a premium of over 67% to Verve’s closing price on Monday.

The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary closing conditions.",1750201272.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1le1m8c/verve_therapeutics_stock_rockets_75_premarket/,investing

CRCL is a 295x earnings Treasury fund that pays Coinbase to exist — and y’all are treating it like it has AI,"Let’s get something straight: Circle (CRCL) is not a tech company. It’s not a fintech revolution. It’s not the next PayPal, or Palantir, or insert whatever delusion Reddit has convinced you of this week.

It’s a money wrapper.

Circle issues **USDC**, a stablecoin. You give them $1, they give you a token worth $1. That’s it. They take your money and park it in short-term U.S. Treasuries. They earn interest, you hold the token. Their entire business is clipping the yield on **your** money. That’s not a metaphor — that’s literally the whole thing.

For the people saying ""Oh look at USDT! They could adopt that investment model of 80% cash equivalents and 20% risky assets!"" Nope. Thanks to the new GENIUS Act, **they are legally only allowed to hold cash or Treasuries under 90 days**. That's it. They **CANNOT** chase yield.

Their 2024 revenue — $1.7 billion — was entirely propped up by **historically high interest rates**. That’s now over. Rates are falling. Every 0.25% Fed rate cut nukes \~$100 million in EBITDA. This thing’s earnings are literally on Powell’s calendar.

And people are out here bidding this thing up like it’s the next AI rocketship? Circle is trading at a **P/E ratio over 2,000** right now. Forward P/E is **295x**, which is still astronomically stupid for a company whose **only value prop is earning 4%** off Treasuries.

Palantir trades at \~300x and at least pretends it's selling AI to the Pentagon. Circle is just rolling your money into T-bills. What exactly are you paying a 295x multiple for? Efficient dollar-holding?

Also — remember that $1.7B revenue? Most of it gets *shaved off* just to stay alive. Circle’s 2024 net profit was only \~$156 million — down **42%** from 2023. Why? Because their **distribution costs exploded**. They spent over $1 billion just to keep USDC circulating.

And most of that money went to **Coinbase**, which made $225.9M off USDC *in Q4 alone*. They probably pulled in \~$900 million total from Circle in 2024. So just to be clear — **Coinbase is making more money off USDC than Circle is**.

In fact, according to Circle’s own S-1 filing, Coinbase gets **50% of USDC net income**, depending on how much USDC is hosted on their platform. In 2022, Coinbase held 5% of USDC. In 2024, they held 20%. Coinbase’s cut just keeps growing. If you think stablecoins are the future, you shouldn’t be buying Circle. You should be buying **Coinbase**, who’s skimming the yield without doing the heavy lifting.

Now here's the dumbest part: if Circle’s market cap ever goes **above the total USDC in circulation** (currently \~$56B), they could literally issue shares, raise cash, and just buy the USDC off the market. That’s how backwards this is — the company doesn’t even own the money it manages.

Circle is just holding **other people’s dollars**. It’s like a bank, except it can’t lend, can’t invest, and doesn’t have deposits of its own. This is not a high-margin software business. It’s a pass-through vehicle that splits revenue and bleeds costs to maintain circulation.

Also, let’s kill the “disrupting payments” fantasy. No one is using USDC at your taco shop. Walmart and Costco already pay nothing in swipe fees because they bully Visa. Small businesses don’t want to lose fraud protection. And the AML/compliance issues make widespread adoption basically dead-on-arrival in the U.S.

There's also absolutely no moat to this business. Paypal already has a stablecoin (PYUSD). Walmart and Amazon are talking about doing their own. Per the GENIUS act, there will be absolutely no advantage in one stablecoin over any other.

So to recap:

* 295x earnings
* Declining profits
* Fed rate exposure
* Paying Coinbase to stay alive
* Zero product upside
* No edge or differential ability in product or service
* And a revenue model that literally disappears in a low-rate environment

This isn’t fintech. This is a Treasury ETF in a trench coat.

**Disclosure**: I opened a small short position on Wednesday. Would’ve gone bigger but there are no shares to borrow right now. If after reading this you still want to hold onto your CRCL stock, at least check that box with your brokerage that'll allow you to lend your shares out so I can short more. You'll earn more yield than Circle.",1750420963.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1lg291k/crcl_is_a_295x_earnings_treasury_fund_that_pays/,wallstreetbets

$50k in CLBR Calls,"https://preview.redd.it/kyijjvdg9x7f1.png?width=2390&format=png&auto=webp&s=907bea8308e8e587646032ac419f9c6e6960f490

Alright regards, I'm back after mentally recovering from paper handing my TSLA puts on possibly the craziest timed DD ever right before Orange tragically dumped Enron (check out my profile if you wanna read through that clusterfuck). With help from my AI therapist, I've recovered and I've moved on to the next play.

Today's topic is CLBR: a right-wing SPAC merger taking GrabAGun public into the ticker PEW (think Star Wars like how those guns go pew pew, pretty dope) so grab a strong drink and sit down cuz we're gonna be comparing it to DJT and how CLBR is likely to mimic that merger but with extra regard strength.

**Status of CLBR merger:**  
CLBR just submitted their 3rd revision of the S-4 (form the SEC requires for mergers). I did a PDF comparison between the 2nd and 3rd revision. They didn't change much, mostly cosmetic stuff as well as some extra outlined risks the SEC probably asked for. The document looks pretty solid. Therefore, I believe it is extremely close to getting approved by the SEC. I estimate it could be as soon as tomorrow. If not tomorrow, definitely next week.

When the S-4 was approved in the DJT merger, DWAC (the sponsor company like how CLBR is the sponsor company for GrabAGun) jumped something like 14%. Not bad.

**What happens after S-4 approval?**  
The shareholders will schedule a date to vote on the merger (spoilers, they will vote yes). When this was announced in the DJT merger, stock fell like 7% ish. Then when the actual merge date was announced, it initially rose then fell something like 14% on the news.

If the same happens with CLBR this will likely be a great entry point for anyone that missed out on S-4 approval. I'm probably going to increase my position if this happens.

**What happens on merge date?**  
We all know what happened to DJT, it made a lot of lucky fucks very wealthy.

***The risk-reward here is just too good to pass up imo.***

**BONUS POINTS**  
That's right regards, I'm not done so grab another drink if you need it.

**Orange Jr.**  
He's directly involved in this merger. We all know how much that family loves to cause a good pump (and eventually dump).

**Financials**  
Unlike Truth Social at the time, GrabAGun is an actual profitable, positive cash flow company. That means that this merger is likely to benefit from both the **meme stock regards (us)** as well as **actual smart investors (not us/other people)**.

In other words, this merger is gonna have both **regard strength** and **fundamental strength**. I wish I could say the same about myself but unfortunately I'm only regard strength.

**Bank Policies**  
Banks are changing their policies with respect to getting involved with companies in the firearms business. And who caused this change? That's right, Mr. Orange Man himself.

Headline: ""Citigroup Reverses Its Firearms Policy Months After Trump Called Out U.S. Banks. Here’s What to Know""

Pretty good timing for a company like GrabAGun, especially considering Orange's son (Orange Jr.) is directly involved. I wonder what else he could say to pump the shit out of this?

**Wartime and Political Uncertainty**  
What do people buy when they think WW3 is about to drop harder than a Drake album? Guns.

**Kelly Reisdorf Added to Board of Directors**  
She's the CEO of USA Shooting, I see future revenue streams opening up with this.

**What my AI Therapist has to say after I told it to do hella research:**  
""VI. Strategic Conclusion for the Sophisticated Investor

The public offerings of DJT, PEW, and NMAX signal the maturation of a distinct and challenging asset class: the politically-branded meme stock. These investment vehicles are defined less by their products or financial statements and more by a powerful narrative that transcends business fundamentals, a reliance on a central political figurehead, and a dedicated base of retail investors who view their participation as an ideological act.

For DJT, the narrative *is* the product; its valuation is a direct reflection of sentiment surrounding Donald Trump, with little to no underlying business to support it. For NMAX, a similar political narrative combined with a low-float IPO structure fueled a brief but spectacular speculative frenzy. The pending PEW merger represents the next evolution of this model. Here, the political narrative serves as a powerful marketing wrapper and valuation accelerant for what appears to be a tangible, profitable underlying business.

The crucial takeaway for the sophisticated investor is the necessity of a dual-track analysis. Traditional fundamental analysis—evaluating revenue, profitability, cash flow, and competitive positioning—remains essential for understanding the long-term viability of the enterprise. However, it is insufficient on its own. It must be paired with an equally rigorous analysis of the political narrative's strength, the loyalty of the retail investor base, and the technical factors, like share float and lock-up periods, that can drive short-term volatility.

The interplay, and often the direct conflict, between these two value drivers—fundamental reality and political narrative—will ultimately determine the stock's trajectory. Investing in these entities is not merely a bet on a company's success; it is a complex and high-risk wager on the direction, intensity, and durability of a political movement.""

**EDIT TO INCLUDE COMMENT:**  
Also worth mentioning: with this being firearms and Orange Jr.-related, there's bound to be some controversy. Especially if this gains traction. More news = more pump, especially if say Fox or NewsMax covers it and the rednecks start buying it up.

Coreweave 9-19 $150 csps for 192k premium,"Wrote 30 crwv (coreweave) 9/19 $150 csps (cash secured puts) for $62/share premium and 1 crwv 9/19 $150 csp for $64.1/share premium. Max profit $192k, max loss if coreweave goes to 0 is $273k. The $192k premium and $465k “cash” are in money market collecting 4 percent interest, which will yield another $6,700 between now and 9/19.

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:

“The general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies’ collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.

Customers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.”

Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. 

Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. 

However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability. 

Best case scenario is that coreweave closes in the $150 range with high IV on 9/19 and I get to run it back again, while collecting more premium and interest.",1750344011.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfchc3,wallstreetbets

SBUX numbers not looking good.,"I am inside a Starbucks waiting for my Venti double caramel frappuccino without whipped cream so this is insider information. 

The place is empty. This is the 7th empty Starbucks I've been to in the last hour. 

SBUX used to be my go to place for picking up girls in 30s and sometimes single moms. I haven't seen a single woman in the last hour. I am going to wait for another 30 minutes pretending to be doing work related stuff on my laptop. 

SBUX is making so many changes and trying hard to reinvent the chain. It is sad, it's like one of those guys pushing 50 but still dressing like a 20 something. It's over you are past it SBUX, let go and act your age.

I am going with June 2026 puts and paying a professional photographer to get pictures for my bumble profile.

Positions: I am planning to get SBUX $90 puts expiring June 2026.

Anyone else have ridiculously high calls on Marvel technology?,"I’ve been holding these for over a month and they have a very strong upside potential. I believe I can get at least $10,000 from these.",1750347010.0,https://i.redd.it/lgfcmjcbkw7f1.jpeg,wallstreetbets
