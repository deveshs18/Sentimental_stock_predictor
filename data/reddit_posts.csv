**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Elon To Oversee Tesla's European Sales After Firing Omead Afshar,"Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-oversee-teslas-europe-us-132132604.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-oversee-teslas-europe-us-132132604.html)

Reads: The source of the problem believes he will be the source of the solution.

No more comparing Tesla's brand damage issue to Bud Light. This is the equivalent of putting Mulvaney in charge of subsequent clean up job. The thing that amazes me most, is that Elon is completely unaware that the problem is **him**. He blamed Afshar as if he could have done something more, fired him (and the entire PR departement a while back if you remember), then with his planet sized ego, puts himself in charge of the problem he needlessly created. What does he think he is going to do? Convince all of Europe to see things his way and change their entire culture to suit his whack-a-doodle views? In his mind, are they all going to be doing the elbowless waves to idolize him by the end of Q3?

Simultaneously, he is now trying to take on the entire US government by going after both sides of the aisle. At what point does the market realize Elon has completely lost his mind? He is clearly having some sort of delusions about taking over the world. His cult followers that were the only ones allowed to ride in the staged Robotaxi ""launch"" understood their mission from their leader. Unless you want to hear a 15-minute Tesla pump session, just skip to the 18:00 mark on this video when he gets out:

(can't post YouTube vids, but see ""I SURVIVED A TESLA ROBOTAXI RIDE (BARELY)"")

Transcript: ""*I'm feeling pretty bullish. I think I am going to buy the stock. This company is about to take over the world I think...*""

They aren't even being subtle about it anymore. They are just telling people to buy the stock because a few select social media influencers were given highly controlled rides and a clear mission to pump. It all seems so desperate. Elon purchased Twitter to build his influence and I speculate somewhere around 10% of his 221+ million followers have had their brain turned to mush by Grok. That is a lot of people that can pump this meme stock. And they probably do think Elon will take over the world and will put their last pennies into that fantasy. Does anyone think that a staged social media campaign based on pure nonsense is enough to keep this stock in absurd P/E range that it has held in at for such a long time?

At what point is the board of Tesla liable to the shareholders for allowing this sort of behavior to continue? I guess they are all too busy selling their shares as fast as their agreements allow them to. Seriously, does anyone look at the insider trading activity and recent high-level departures of this company as have any doubts as to what is going on inside this rapidly failing company?

Australia's $6 Trillion Iron Ore Discovery Set to Transform Global Markets,"https://oilprice.com/Metals/Commodities/Australias-6-Trillion-Iron-Ore-Discovery-Set-to-Transform-Global-Markets.html


Australia’s $6 trillion iron ore discovery will boost supply and likely lower global iron ore prices. 

A new Rio Tinto and China Baowu Joint venture mine will add even more output, keeping Australia the top supplier while China stays the biggest buyer.

Lower iron ore prices mean cheaper steel, which helps US companies like GM and Ford cut vehicle production costs. 

Nucor and US Steel can benefit too, as cheaper raw materials can improve their profit margins and make their steel more competitive. 

Overall, lower iron ore prices can lift earnings for automakers, machinery makers, and steel producers, supporting share prices if other costs stay stable.",1751372145.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lp03t6/australias_6_trillion_iron_ore_discovery_set_to/,stocks
Trump Takes Aim at Musk Over EV Subsidies; Tesla Shares Slump,"Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump lashed out at Elon Musk on Tuesday, accusing the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive officer of benefiting excessively from government electric vehicle subsidies. Tesla shares tumbled.

“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. 

“No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!,” he added.

This comes after Musk slammed the US Senate’s latest version of Trump’s multi-trillion dollar tax bill, warning that the cuts to EV and other clean energy credits would be “incredibly destructive” to the country. Tesla shares slumped 5.8% in European premarket trading on Tradegate.

Tesla has benefitted from a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles that Trump’s bill will eliminate. The automaker is set to release second-quarter sales later this week that will likely show a further slump in demand.

“Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate,” Trump said. “It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one.”",1751356761.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lovx48/trump_takes_aim_at_musk_over_ev_subsidies_tesla/,stocks

Trump Oversees Worst Dollar Start to Year in Over Half a Century,"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-oversees-worst-dollar-start-year-over-half-century-2092446

T The U.S. dollar has had its worst start to a year since 1973, weighed down by President Donald Trump's trade policy, a worsening outlook for the country's ever-growing public debt, and concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve.

The Financial Times reported that the U.S. Dollar Index had declined by 10 percent over the course of 2025, marking the weakest performance since the end of the Bretton Woods system, which was underpinned by the dollar's convertibility to gold.

Trump has staked much of his political reputation on his handling of the economy, pitching himself as the leader who can slash household bills, put more money in Americans' pockets through lower taxes, and lift commerce into a new golden age.

The dollar news coincides with the U.S. Senate gearing up to pass Trump's much-tweaked One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the tax-cutting provisions of which are set to expand the deficit by trillions of dollars over the coming decade, putting pressure on the dollar.",1751311149.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1logjlz/trump_oversees_worst_dollar_start_to_year_in_over/,stocks

US dollar suffers worst start to year since 1973,"The US dollar is headed for its worst first half of the year since 1973, as Donald Trump’s trade and economic policies prompt global investors to rethink their exposure to the world’s dominant currency. The dollar index, which measures the currency’s strength against a basket of six others including the pound, euro and yen, has slumped more than 10 per cent so far in 2025, the worst start to the year since the end of the gold-backed Bretton Woods system. “The dollar has become the whipping boy of Trump 2.0’s erratic policies,” said Francesco Pesole, an FX strategist at ING.

Home Depot said Monday unit SRS Distribution has agreed to acquire specialty building products distributor GMS for about $4.3 billion, stepping up its efforts to capture more demand from professional contractors.

Home Depot's SRS Distribution has outbidded the $5 billion hostile takeover attempt by QXO, led by billionaire Brad Jacobs. The deal including the debt, valued at $5.5 billion, offers $110 per GMS share, a 36% premium over its June 18 price. GMS shares rose 11.8% to $108.83.

The acquisition strengthens SRS’s network with over 1,200 locations and 8,000 trucks, targeting professional contractors as homeowner spending on renovations declines. The deal, following Home Depot’s $18.25 billion SRS purchase, is set to close by fiscal 2025, funded by cash and debt.",1751377462.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lp21rv/home_depot_targets_contractors_is_acquiring_gms/,stocks

"As a long term investor, how to strategize my exit plan (when to sell)?","I know when a company is at a bargain to buy. Problem is, I know when to buy, but I don’t know when to sell. Do I sell when I need the money or when doctor tells me I only got a month to live? 

Let me give you several examples:

I was able to buy lots of Celsius stocks at $8 basis in 2020 when I began trying their drinks, enjoyed it and began seeing Celsius drinks sold everywhere at grocery markets and convenience stores. I felt confident. Celsius rose all the way to $95, the stock split and dropped all the way back to $25. Obviously, I did not sell any.

Same thing applies to FSLY, SQ, SE when I did not sell at the peak and watched them drop all the way back to my entry price then I panic sold and only secured a very little gain.

SMCI - I also panic sold at $23.81 for small gain and obviously, watching the price going back up is lots of pain. 

I was able to buy lots of crowdstrike last year in July when the outage caused chaos within airport and various companies. I also scooped some UNH as well due to recent (to me, it’s overreaction) free fall. 

I bought lots of ASTS at $11 and sold at $30 to get my entry money back. Then it went all the way to $46. 

Lots of people say, if a stock gives you 25% to 50%, it makes sense for you to sell all, take the profit and run. It’s not true at all. If you sold NVDA, TSLA, AMD and PLTR at 30% gain, you probably cried yourself to sleep every night. Some of the companies do have ten-fold potential if you decide to hold long. And selling them also subject yourself to short term capital gain tax. 

Also, PLTR PE ratio skyrockets. I understand military contract and AI reliance are legit, but there’s no guarantee for price to hold. When is a good time to sell? Which companies have bright future to hold strong despite free fall? Nobody has a crystal ball I understand but does reading business financial statement and learning their fundamental/ business model/ ecological system gives you a clue? 

Market is at ATH carried by major techs due to AI replacing humans leading to boost in company’s profit margin and future earning potential. But correction will eventually come. 

I need investing veterans to give me some guidances here? Appreciate it!!

You are exit liquidity - Pt 2,"The last time I posted we were a few days from bloody liberation day.

This time we're staring down a large number of unemployment and the delayed realization of tariff impacts at grocery store. From January to May 2025, U.S. companies across sectors announced approximately 696,000 job cuts, this does not even count the people who were pipped/fired from corporations to avoid paying severance (yes this happens and it is pretty shitty).

How does this affect the stock market?

According to Vanguard and Fidelity 2024 data:

* Total average contributions from both employee + employer: \~$11,000–$13,000/year

Lets just pull 580k out of our asses and do a bit of math.

580k Jobs \* $900 contributions a month = $522 Million a month.

Combine this with the fed's definition of unemployment which excludes those working uber or doordash to make ends meet:

* Underemployment: The official unemployment rate classifies anyone working at least one hour a week as employed, regardless of whether it's part-time, temporary, or below their skill level. This can distort the picture, as many people may be struggling financially despite being counted as employed.

The fed only surveys 60k households a month to get a rough estimate of unemployment numbers. 

In my honest opinion....

Liquidity has been high because everyone is positioning themselves after triple witching day. Retail who got laid off received their 401k and re-invested into the stock market. 

Layoffs are at an all time high and continuing, unemployment is completely understated. The financial structure sits on a foundation of Jenga blocks with the fed propping it up. The question is not how high it can go, its how long before we sustain a prolonged crash. I am honestly just writing this because I have nobody else to talk to about investing.

Opendoor $275k Double Down,"Following up on my last Opendoor [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kmaqin/opendoor_is_the_next_carvana/). I increased my $OPEN bet to $255k, up $20k today:

https://preview.redd.it/orioq6i4yaaf1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2bdc89a76cefccd798bd377b06d376b7f04938a

After my last post Reddit put in at least $30M into this stock. Then the last 6 weeks sucked:

* 80M shares were shorted, 11% of total shares
* Delisted from Russell, etfs were forced to sell 4%+ of shares 
* Scary articles about Nasdaq delisting, reverse splits, shareholder lawsuits, layoffs, convertible bonds
* Fed refuses to lower rates
* Stock is down 20%

I still think it’s a great bet here, and none of that changes my outlook on the company. But I figure many of you bought in here just trying to catch a meme rally that fizzled out, and now you’re stuck with a stupid stock that’s down 20%. $30M is a lot of money, and some of you put in 6 figures. I wanted to give that crowd a balanced, less-jokey DD so you can decide if you want to keep this as an investment.

All the arguments from the first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1kmaqin/opendoor_is_the_next_carvana/) are still true, go read that if you haven’t.

**Q2 Data Meets Guidance**

I pay for a data feed on Opendoor’s next quarter:

https://preview.redd.it/gd1kphd8yaaf1.png?width=1999&format=png&auto=webp&s=c73b0ad5edf57ded60e826aa0d458e1a3523fbf5

(Source: [datadoor.io](http://datadoor.io))

Q2 Guidance was for $1.35B - $1.45B sales and 4.5% - 4.9% contribution margin (i.e. margin after holding and sales costs). The data we have shows $1.26B through June 15, so as the next two weeks come in we’ll hit revenue guidance. Contribution margin is usually 4% less than gross margin, so we’ll also hit the margin guidance. Seems very likely we’re on track for management’s guidance of $0-$20M Ebitda profit, which would make this the first Ebitda profitable quarter in three years. There is a noticeable drop in sales in June. Opendoor is selling through its inventory hard, so I think this is dropping just because they have fewer houses to sell.

**Acquisitions**

Management guided in Q1, that they’ve decided to buy fewer houses in the Summer and more in the Winter. Houses have peak prices in the peak Summer months, and if Opendoor doesn’t flip them quickly it often has to hold them until next Spring and sell at a loss. Also, Opendoor knows this means house prices are going to drop this Fall:

https://preview.redd.it/ih2qqn0myaaf1.png?width=1890&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f0d45108c98d33327dc6e169fc56602572a678

A crash isn’t expected btw, HousingWire and Redfin have been saying things like 1-3% annual drops. Still, a 5-10% drop is a possibility. 

So they’re playing defense right now, buying ⅓ as many houses as last year:

https://preview.redd.it/f2e2j6nsyaaf1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=627ed4237cec821040aba80b2966ad348dd5d637

It’s possible the shorts are seeing this data and think the company is in trouble. I think it’s a smart move. With low inventory this Fall they’re going to be protected from drops in house prices, and they’ll have cash to buy from distressed sellers this Winter. 

Lower acquisitions does mean revenue will drop a lot this Fall. Margins however will be much higher, because Opendoor is offering worse deals:

https://preview.redd.it/aa5m476xyaaf1.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd35a9b971e6db3ee0b99ebf3bd4236c757c8036

Also note there is a new agent referral program this Summer, where Opendoor is sending customers to local real estate agents and collecting referral fees. I talked to a real estate broker that’s very bullish about this, he tells me agents will pay half of their commissions just for a new lead. That program is almost certainly contributing to lowered acquisitions this Summer, but it’s likely being replaced with risk-free commission revenue. 

So to me the drop in acquisitions is good. We were told to expect this to protect the company against house price drops this Fall. The revenue drop will be offset by higher margins and referral fees. Expenses will also be much lower. I will be concerned if acquisitions don’t rise in Q4, but right now I think this is a good thing. 

**Inventory Health**

Holding times are way too long. The average house takes 142 days to sell, up from 117 last year.

https://preview.redd.it/230ukp4zyaaf1.png?width=1999&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7e57ca3991eafd22af51cf59ca2f4ac4c6256ee

They’ve sold through a ton of houses this quarter, and the remaining houses have good margins on average, so I’m not too concerned. It seems this is the result of buying too many houses in the Summer and being unable to sell them in the slow Fall and Winter seasons. This issue should be fixed now that they’re buying more in the Winter.

**Russell Rebalancing**

The Russell rebalancing thing happened. 83M net new shorts were added in the last few months:

https://preview.redd.it/0vxrt6u0zaaf1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=36d88ea8f1ec4115579a079a51bf1034f6103d09

At the end of the day on the 27th, about 100M shares were traded, including 62M at the closing auction:

https://preview.redd.it/ojoyzwii0baf1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=6962988dc0dcb1d1f347e10bd68d49dfe1069af8

That was the Russell etfs selling their shares to hedge funds, who presumably built up a big short position ahead of time so they wouldn’t be stuck with 62M $OPEN shares they have to sell. 

So now the shorting pressure should let up a bit now, since the hedge funds aren’t building up a huge short position in anticipation of this event. The stock is also becoming hard to borrow, shorts have to pay interest now:

https://preview.redd.it/ys8e3pw4zaaf1.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d02ab9d495fc7517d46bcb91aa8bc5c730c168

All of that means the nonstop shorting pressure should at least slow down, which means this might be a bottom for the stock. No panic from the shorts though unfortunately. We will probably need a great Q2 and rates to lower for that to happen.

**Management Pay tied to Profit**

Some positive news: Executive pay in [April](https://investor.opendoor.com/static-files/31a16aba-1e47-4865-be1f-159d817bac35) got tied to company profits, which means the CEO’s pay is getting cut this year from $17M to $750k. The company also brought on new directors, a new CTO and an ex-Google CTO in November. Twitter’s former COO joined the board in June. It’s a good sign that quality people are still joining the company. 

**Opendoor Agent Program**

Opendoor finally did a [public release](https://www.opendoor.com/agents) of their new agent program I had mentioned. It’s a huge change. Opendoor fired or reassigned their internal sales team, 110 people, and are now sending local real estate agents to customers homes to help them decide if they actually want to sell to Opendoor or if they want to list normally. Opendoor and the agent both get a cut of the profit whatever the customer decides. Their website also shows this:

https://preview.redd.it/50xdryy6zaaf1.png?width=317&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ed302d0895736270bdbf7aa473a37cd690483fd

Which means the real estate agents are also going to be selling Opendoor-owned homes, possibly under their own brands.

Some investors aren’t going to like this, because Opendoor was the company that was supposed to get rid of real estate agents. I think it’s good, because Opendoor is kinda garbage at selling their homes. Like, did you guys know Opendoor doesn’t use for sale signs in some cities? Squatters figured out an Opendoor sign means the house is unoccupied, so Opendoor can’t put signs up. Opendoor also expects customers to download an app and do a self-guided tour of a house, which often turns out to be musty and unstaged. It’s high tech, some people probably like it, but older generations expect to be able to call someone up and do a house tour, and right now boomers are the only ones that can afford to buy houses. 

So sure, Opendoor will have to pay agents. Those costs are offset by firing their internal sales team. In return their houses will now have for sale signs, will be clean and staged with furniture, and will have an agent hustling to sell them. Resale values should go up and holding times should go down. This is very possibly a business-saving change. 

**Nasdaq Delisting & Reverse Split**

Opendoor got a Nasdaq delisting threat, because its share price has been below $1. $OPEN has to stay above $1 for 10 consecutive trading days by the end of November or it will get removed from Nasdaq, which would be stupid for a company with $6B annual sales. 

Management has 3 options:

1. Run the company better
2. Reverse Split
3. Share buyback

They’re been running the company better. Hopefully the market recognizes this by November. A share buyback is possible but unlikely, since Opendoor wants to preserve cash while the housing market is dead. 

That leaves a reverse split. Opendoor sent out a shareholder [vote](https://investor.opendoor.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opendoor-announces-preliminary-proxy-filing-seeking-approval) asking approval for a reverse split, if necessary, by November. Personally, if it happens, it’s not something that will bother me. I think a lot of people are upset because they think reverse splits mean dilution is coming. They had $693M cash in Q1 and will have more in Q2, they really don’t need to dilute here to raise cash. A reverse split would be embarrassing if the stock doesn’t recover by November, but imo the only damage is psychological.

**Zillow advertises Opendoor**

Virtually everyone in the US uses Zillow “Zestimate” of their home value. When they do, Zillow automatically pitches them an Opendoor offer:

https://preview.redd.it/vukwx2f9zaaf1.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=881bceae9644c9f6c8165182b4ec9b50095d3aa3

If they end up taking the offer, Opendoor pays a commission. It’s a huge marketing funnel for Opendoor, they get 40% of their customers through this channel.

Right now Opendoor can’t afford to make good offers, because the housing market is frozen and prices look ready to drop. When things stabilize more and Opendoor starts making better offers, this funnel could turn into a nice revenue multiplier.

**Bear Case**

Let’s imagine the worst-case scenario. Opendoor lost $392M last year. It’s very likely they’ll narrow that loss, but let’s suppose they only narrow it to $200M per year. Then let's suppose we get some inflation from tariffs and the Fed raises mortgage rates, causing house prices to drop 10% a year for the next two years. Despite positioning defensively, Opendoor incurs $150M in write downs and is out of cash by the end of 2026. 

Does the company have any terminal value in this scenario? I’ve heard from two people that work in institutional real estate that argued Opendoor would be bought out before it goes bankrupt. The company has a ton of assets: billions in homes, a pricing algorithm backed by a decade of data, the Zillow partnership, brokerage licenses in almost every state, relationships with real estate agents, home builders and repair contractors across the country. Both of these people agree Opendoor could be acquired for way more than $400M. 

**Conclusion**

Opendoor is a stupid San Francisco tech company that’s been learning how real estate works. This quarter they started working with real estate agents. Real estate agents are only good for putting signs in front of houses, staging them with furniture, and giving tours. Opendoor didn’t know how to do that because tech companies only know how to do apps and algorithms. But now they’ve learned new tricks like for sale signs, they’ll start making more money, and stock goes up.

In all seriousness though the new management seems competent. The company might blow up if we get more inflation and the Fed keeps rates high. But if they pull the comeback off, this is a tech company with a P/S of 0.07, it will be a stupid ROI.",1751393861.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lp945r/opendoor_275k_double_down/,stocks

Two situations that you need to understand - USD devaluation and Liquidity,"There are a few schools of thought here that say USD has devalued and hence stocks are increasing in value and then the second being the continuous influx of liquidity through 401k and other DCA contributions that is keeping the market floating (or rising in our case). Let's break this down

**1)** The quarterly rate of 401k and other retirement contributions has not changed by a lot - still at the 12-14% rate of income in the latest quarter too. Here is the thing - this has been consistent for years and people are missing the point that all recent and previous crashes and rallies continued to happen irrespective of this constant flow of money - So **stop imagining that this 401K money is keeping market up** \- **market is and has always moved disproportionate to this influx of 401k / DCA money** and there are larger players that impact the trend.

**2)** USD devaluation - yes USD is devaluing - example USD - EUR has dropped 10+% vs SPY is literally flat YTD (even after the big liberation week drop and post rally). This just means that SPY is 10% cheaper in the international market and still has room to grow in USD denomination markets (i.e. US Markets). **The only way the market rally breaks is if USD stabilizes making US stocks more expensive.** This has been a change in my thought recently.

**Positions:** Just bought SPY calls for 650 expiring Dec 2026 - rationale - expecting continued momentum and then a sharp drop - expecting to sell before the sharp drop (yes catching the dropping knife sometimes before September).",1751307966.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lof5pk/two_situations_that_you_need_to_understand_usd/,stocks
Why the META narrative is underappreciated.,"This is my understanding of Zuckerberg's intent throughout Meta/Facebook's history.

1. Social Graph (2004-2011) - mapping real-world connections into digital form.
2. Data Extraction (2011-2018) - monetizing attention by modeling & manipulating behavior.
3. Platform Defense (2018-2022) - protect Meta's empire from regulators & competitive threats.
4. AI Bootstrapping (2022-2024) - training AI models using the world's richest behavioral dataset.
5. Interface Reinvention (2025-present)- building a new human-computer interface around persistent presence.
6. Sovereign AI (2025-present) - position Meta as a public-good default for everyday reasoning, commerce & relationships.

The last two appear to be parallel tracks that may eventually converge into Zuckerberg’s long-term vision: a persistent, AI-powered metaverse.

Zuckerberg is already moving aggressively - quietly assembling one of the strongest AI teams in the world, including talent responsible for key breakthroughs in open-source LLMs.

Most investors are still treating Meta like an ad business. Meta’s ad revenue is just the cashflow shell -  the real architecture being built is a sovereign operating system for human interaction.

Most people think the Circle IPO is flopping but they are wrong.,"The Circle IPO has been one of those rare market moments that force even the most skeptical to open their eyes, their minds.

This issuer of US dollar stablecoin went public on June 5th at $31 and closed yesterday at $180 ($44B market cap), down from a staggering $300.

Most people still barely know what a dollar stablecoin is, and even fewer know how they work.

Some people have heard that dollar stablecoin adoption will extend the greenback’s reign as the global reserve currency for decades to come. It will. 

But not many understand why. And forward-thinking strategists forecast that dollar stablecoins will soon become the world’s leading buyers of treasury bills, replacing nations like China and Japan as the largest lenders to the US government.

Most people scoff at that notion. They’re wrong.

The world is changing fast. And it is generally true that investors who tune into the wisdom of markets succeed, often spectacularly, while the others trail, fail.

It's not difficult to realize most people are done with searching stuff on multiple websites. Even ChatGPT can handle boomers writing type (Google can't)

Google(and websites) ruined google search, prioritized ads, and the overall internet website stuff became supper annoying (pop-ups, cookies, ads, login, subscribe to read the full content).

  
Now, why I think they are pushing Google stock? I think they realized the company is going to get hammered hard in the next decades and it's easy to see that google can't execute for a long time, to try to salvage the situation. And they want to opt-out and find better AI plays.

Are diversified equity portfolios effectively inflation-resistant long term?,"I've always worked off the assumption that equities/stocks are about as inflation proof as any asset/investment you can own, except for maybe gold and real estate. My likely flawed reasoning is that although inflation may adversely impact a company's profitability, the price of the stock will mostly go up over time as inflation impacts it because most of the assets of the entity will also increase from inflation. I'm effectively 100 percent invested in the S&P 500 and plan to stay that way for a while as my investment horizon is about 20 years.

Found a mysterious unclaimed very old stock,Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post in but I was cleaning my house recently and I found a stock that my grandfather purchased in 1944. It is 1 share in Brown County Cooperative Association (a farmers co op in aberdeen sd). I have been trying to find the co op online to see if it is worth anything but when I spoke to the county office they said it had disbanded. Is it worth pursuing this further or should I just give up on it?

How do you allocate across retirement and personal accounts?,"I have 1/3 of my investments in tax advantaged accounts and 2/3 in a taxable account.

I could buy/sell in the tax advantaged accounts and pay no taxes now. But over time that will probably mean more bonds and low risk assets in the taxable accounts advantaged accounts (assuming the economy grows over the next 20 years). 

Is it a better idea to try and keep my higher risk/return investments in my tax advantaged accounts? Even if it means selling at a gain and paying taxes in my taxable account?

Or do you all balance every account to your targets? Or have different targets for taxable and tax advantaged accounts?

Alternative Investment Strategy besides going all in buying the dip and DCA,"Let's say I'm really bullish on HOOD and I have $100k cash to invest now. 

Instead of putting all $100k into HOOD at its near all-time-high, or, instead of putting $10k into HOOD every 2 weeks for the next 5 months, what if... I put all $100k into VTI right now, and then whenever there's a dip (let's say 10%), I swap some of the VTI out and into HOOD and do that several times - what are your thoughts on this strategy? 

The idea is whenever there's a dip, when VTI goes down 10%, HOOD would likely go down much more, like 30%, because individual stocks are more volatile than total market fund, especially risk asset like HOOD. I know this is like timing the market, but I'm thinking this is doing it in a slightly different way where I'm still invested in VTI while I wait and not out of the market completely with a load of cash. At the same time I can profit from the difference in volatility between VTI and HOOD should a dip take place.

Now please tell me what are all the things that could go wrong with this strategy. ",1751389970.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lp7e2y/alternative_investment_strategy_besides_going_all/,investing
"First time doing a private placement real estate investment, is there anything I'm missing?","I'm looking to add about 10-15% real estate to my portfolio. I've been offered access to a private placement funding two buildings of student housing attached to a college. There are about 250 units and almost all are currently paying rent.

To be clear, I'm only looking to invest the minimum in this one (50k) until I make sure I didn't miss anything. I have about 3mm in my portfolio plus a house and an income of 250k base and 550k semi-illiquid stock a year. (I count this stock as worth zero even though it's in a very solid company). My wife also works. My portfolio is mostly VTI with about 25% international stocks and 5% gold. I'm looking to retire in 20 years.

The private placement has a ten year lockup and a projected IRR of 13.5% after the company gets their share. I'd get small rent payments quarterly with a lump sum after five years and a bigger lump sum when they sell or recapitalize the properties after 10 years. I'm guaranteed the first 9% of any money made before the company gets anything. They also offer 9% interest until the placement closes in October.

The person behind the placement has a solid 20 year history of these projects in this area and the average IRR on his placements is 19% - this one is considered much more conservative because the properties are already full of students paying rent, thus the lower IRR.

My understanding is that the rent payments can be tax deferred due to depreciation. Is this correct?

What I'm wondering is: what don't I know? The numbers seem reasonable given the fact that it's an illiquid investment that I can't cash out for ten years but I don't mind that because I'm saving for retirement in 20.

Obviously there are some catastrophic risks like fraud, embezzlement or just the college going out of business but I can afford to lose the full 50k if this happened. Is the rate of return worth the lock up and the lack of geographical diversification? It seems like a reasonable anti-recession strategy - people actually increase college attendance when the economy sucks.

I really can’t decide as it’s not FDIC insured but if SGOV goes to shit I don’t think FDIC is going to do much either as it’s backed my by US… ?

Also doesn’t HYSA just invest in treasury bills anyways so it’s the same thing but through a big company when I can just have it all in my hands. The rate different will most likely be half a percent sgov va HYSA. So at the end of the day it really is barely different

Investing by Percentage of Paycheck | Do You Include Company Match When Calculating?,"When you review your plan for investing from your paycheck...at what point do you consider company match funds?

I mean...for those with company match, that matching amount is there regardless, obviously.  But if you are trying to plan for X% of your paycheck to go towards investing...do you ignore the company match when making those calculations?

For me personally, I don't consider the company match when I make plans and calculate.  My company match is 6%.  If I want to hit 15% investing for each paycheck, I'm not calculating the company match when coming up with the answer to ""Am I now at 15% per paycheck?""

If I get into a discussion with someone over how much I invest (which I rarely share) ... I would say that I invest 15%.  I would not say 15% me + 6% company = 21% total.

how do you invest for the singularity,"I am convinced that we will probably reach AGI (artificial general intelligence) in less than 5 years, and ASI (artificial super intelligence/ ai smarter than all humans) shortly after.  
However, looking around, it seems to me that ordinary people are extremely underestimating the pace of AI progress and, above all, its capacity to transform the world.  
But this has been discussed often here. What I want to ask you instead is: how can I leverage this intuition?  
The best way I've thought of is investing. If AI has the ability to radically change the world and replace most jobs, then it will also be worth a ridiculous amount of money.  
Giving a precise estimate is impossible, but it doesn't seem hard to imagine that an ASI capable of creating fusion reactors, immortality (rejuvenation), and hundreds of new materials could be worth tens or hundreds of [trillions.So](http://trillions.so/), I started investing and learning about this world, but it seems to me that most of the advice, principles, and metrics used are useless.  
Things like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and growth prospects are not useful if an ASI is created.  
Even among funds dedicated to AI companies and among investors betting on AI, it seems to me that they are still thinking with the wrong mindset.  
In fact, as soon as an ASI is created, a lot of companies will lose their value very quickly.  
What is the value of Nvidia if an ASI creates a better chip in 2 months? What value can software have (Office, Windows, whatever Palantir does) if an AI can program a custom operating system in half a day?  
Therefore, in my opinion, the logic for a long-term investment should be:

1. The quantity of physical resources available (datacenters, foundries, power plants, robots).
2. The ability to be the first (or among the first) to develop an AGI/ASI.

Based on these principles, I believe the best companies for the long term are:  
Google, ASML (creates the machines to make chips), TSMC, Amazon (owns a bit of Anthropic, and a bit of Digit (robots)), Microsoft (OpenAI, servers), Meta (although I doubt their ability to reach AGI first), Intel (foundries), Tesla (humanoid robots).

A possible problem with investing, however, is that we will most likely see a recession caused by job losses. It would be a great shame to invest now and not wait for the probable crash.What do you think?

Funds Missing After Custodial to Individual Account Transfer on E*TRADE,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping someone can shed some light on an issue I'm having with an E\*TRADE account transfer.

Here's a timeline of what happened:

The Setup: I had a custodial account (under my dad's name) with an automatic investment plan. Every Wednesday, this plan would pull money from my bank to my E\*TRADE account. The following Tuesday, it would use those funds to buy into a specific investment.

The Deposit: Last Wednesday, the automatic transfer from my bank to my custodial E\*TRADE account went through as usual.

The Account Transfer: Two days later, on Friday, I initiated a full account transfer from my custodial account to a new individual E\*TRADE account under my name. At this point, the money from Wednesday's deposit was still ""unsettled"" and not yet available for withdrawal (this usually took about three business days, clearing on Monday).

The Result: The account transfer was completed today. However, the funds from last Wednesday's automatic deposit are not in my new individual account. My old custodial account is now closed.

I called E\*TRADE customer support, and the representative was able to see my old, closed custodial account. He confirmed it has a $0 balance. He mentioned that the pending deposit from last Wednesday was ""swept"" and ""reinvested"" during the account transfer process.

My problem is that I don't see these funds or any corresponding investment in my new account.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Can anyone explain what ""swept"" means in this context and where my money might have gone? Any advice on what my next steps should be would be greatly appreciated!",1751323259.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lolkro/funds_missing_after_custodial_to_individual/,investing

Play for US Debt Refinancing,"Hi everyone,

US needs to refinance $12 out of $36 trillion it owes over the next 12 years. Obviously the lenders will know this and since there is no other way than US to take the new debt, they will impose higher rates.

These days might be the perfect time to make a trade because the rates are down over the “calm” in financial markets and ceasefire in middle east. Starting autumn, we may see volatility and sudden peaks for bond rates somedays. I wouldn’t be surprised if we talk 5-5.5% rates again.

So I want to benefit from bond prices falling and yields rising. You may not agree with this but that’s not what I’m asking.

Imagine this theory holds true. What is the best way to profit from the upcoming bond price collapse. Unfortunately you cannot short the bonds (atleast not us retail investors). There are indirect ways of doing it such as shorting tech stocks or bank stocks that may not act that way 100%.

Israeli stocks will boom over the next decade,"It is no secret valuations for US equities are extremely high. It is best to look at international markets for diversification. One of the countries that is a good option is Israel.

Israel trades at cheap valuation with a PE ratio of 14.5 despite its indices being at ATH. This is for obvious reasons such as the high geopolitical risk. But I believe the risk is mostly overblown. The Hong Kong indices trade at similar PE ratio despite having 100x more political risk being in a country that is a hostile to the US. If you buy Chinese stocks there's a much higher risk of losing it all from an event like the 2022 sanctions on Russia.

Since Israel is an ally to the US and is a developed country it is much more investor friendly and safer to invest in than China. But of course it trades cheaply because of middle east instability. But as a nuclear power, there is no chance it will collapse barring an global apocalyptic scenario.

The shittiness from middle east instability is already priced in. Thats why the PE ratio is low. Hence, its far more likely that things could improve and Israeli companies will continue to moon. We saw the Tel Aviv indices rally from the limited Iranian response to the US strikes.

Israel is in a stronger position than ever. With the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria that's one less hostile neighbor they have to worry about. If things continue to go their way this will increase investor confidence in the Israeli shekels and further boost their markets.

The value of the shekel is another important thing to note. Like other foreign currencies, in the past decade the shekel deappreciated against the US dollar. The Israeli market performed poorly with other foreign markets in the past during the US dollar bull run. Currency risk is the real problem.

With the current administration, the us dollar is now weakening and foreign currencies are gaining ground. The appreciation of the shekel this year has already made the Israeli markets outperform the US. If ww3 happens then everything goes to zero anyways and no market will be safe. But if things improve in the middle east then israeli companies will moon.

I'm buying EIS right now for the sake of diversification but liquidity is not great unfortunately. IBKR does offer direct purchases to the Tel Aviv exchange though.

Also institutions are being pressured to divest from Israel because of social concerns. But the stock market doesn't care about subjective morals so this is just a further discount for investors. Think about how well PLTR did.

Lastly I do not endorse any particular view, this is just a foreign market that I think will boom.",1751374445.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lp0wpd/israeli_stocks_will_boom_over_the_next_decade/,investing
"Am I too uninformed to make individual stock picks? I’m very risk-tolerant, but want to be disciplined and don’t want to just be gambling.","TLDR: Just got into investing a few months ago. Even if I’m risk-tolerant, is it silly to allocate \~10% of my portfolio to stocks that I picked myself?

I’m 24M with a stable job, low expenses; higher risk profile than most. Trying to make the most of the situation by investing as much as possible for long-term growth.

I read that a core-satellite portfolio is a decent strategy, where you have a lower-risk, diversified core position and a higher-risk/speculative satellite position. I decided on a 70/25/5 split of core/sattelite/crypto. I invested a lot lump-sum, then wised up and set up automations to DCA a good chunk of my paycheck into this portfolio every month (around $3,000 invested per month). I have \~$40k in my investment portfolio right now; haven’t really touched it but I’m considering rebalancing.

Here’s the high-level breakdown:

Core (70%): Maxing out a Roth IRA investing into FZROX. The rest of the 70% goes into VTI, in a normal brokerage account.

Satellite (25%): Around 50% in tech/growth-based ETFs, the rest in individual stock picks. I work in tech (big data), so most of my picks are fairly speculative tech stocks, like cloud computing, aerospace, AI, quantum, etc. My analysis was super basic; I just picked small-med size companies in sectors that I can see growing in the next 10, 20, 30+ years, based on my own personal experience.

Crypto (5%): Mainly BTC/ETH; I see a lot of growth potential because I can see crypto becoming more widely used as my generation comes into wealth. This is something I truly believe in and I’m not willing to budge on (other than rebalancing for risk management, if needed).



I have a few specific questions:

1. If you were in my position, would you keep that \~10% invested in individual stock picks? If not, how would you reallocate?

2. Am I right in my analysis that investing in those more volatile/speculative stocks will generally decrease the expected return on my investment (i.e., it won’t outperform the market), while increasing the overall volatility of my portfolio?

3. Is time horizon a factor? E.g., if I held those speculative stocks for 10, 20, 30+ years, would that investment then become more valuable than throwing it all into VTI or QQQ, for example? Just for the chance of hitting a moonshot?",1751321347.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1loktb9/am_i_too_uninformed_to_make_individual_stock/,investing
How do you think progress in AI will impact investing and the economy?,"Currently in the middle of the FIRE journey, but a little anxious about the future of economics in general. AI is advancing at a rate that I think most people are not ready for. What happens to FIRE plans if 50% of people lose their jobs in the next 5-10 years? If the government has to provide universal basic income, what does having money even mean? 

Also, if the majority of jobs are replaced by ai, who will be buying the products and services that these companies provide? How will people be able to pay mortgages with no income? Will this entirely change the economy and what it means to use currency and/or wealth? 

I guess I'm just looking to hear what you guys think. I feel like I may make all of these sacrifices for decades only for my money to be worthless and the economy to be completely different by the time it comes to FIRE. 

And if you think I'm being dramatic, pretty much everyone working or forecasting in this field is predicting some version of this. Salesforce CEO said ai is already doing 30-50% of all jobs at his company. Lots of layoffs in software jobs, and it will only spread to other white collar jobs.

"Large AI Hyperscallers Are Looking to Purchase Bitcoin Mining Data Centers for Fast Expansion, such as Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) CleanSpark Inc. (CLSK)","Large hyperscalers, particularly those focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC), are increasingly looking towards the Bitcoin mining sector. This interest isn't directly related to investing in Bitcoin mining itself, but rather driven by the advantages Bitcoin mining facilities offer in meeting the massive power demands of AI and HPC operations.

2 of the largest bitcoin mining facilities with the most Data Centers are Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) & CleanSpark Inc. (CLSK)

Riot Platforms is already undertaking a strategic shift towards becoming a hyperscale infrastructure provider which involves leveraging their existing infrastructure and expertise to build and operate large-scale data centers for various clients beyond crypto mining, primarily focusing on cloud computing and AI services. 

Here's why hyperscalers are interested in Bitcoin mining facilities:

* Power Requirements: AI and HPC applications require immense computational power and energy, far exceeding traditional data center needs. Bitcoin mining facilities already possess the infrastructure and access to large, often cheaper, power sources necessary for such intensive operations.
* Deployment Timelines: Building new high-performance computing (HPC) data centers from scratch can take years, with lengthy waits for electrical grid connections. Repurposing existing Bitcoin mining facilities can significantly reduce these timelines, allowing hyperscalers to deploy AI services more efficiently.
* Existing Infrastructure and Expertise: Bitcoin miners have experience in building and managing large-scale data centers, including electrical, mechanical, facilities, and security teams. This expertise can streamline the transition for hyperscalers looking to scale quickly.
* Attractive Power Contracts: Bitcoin mining companies often have attractive power contracts, which can be appealing to hyperscalers looking to secure their energy needs efficiently. ",1751309224.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lofpfo/large_ai_hyperscallers_are_looking_to_purchase/,investing

I reverse-engineered Russell 3k index rebalancing using ChatGPT and nailed 80% of additions - here’s how.,"Index rebalancing is a popular trade among event-driven investors.

This might sound outrageous, but I used ChatGPT o3 and a collection of Russell construction and reconstitution papers to build a surprisingly effective index rebalancing prediction model.  On this first iteration, I have just focused on additions to the Russell 3k.

Here's a high level overview of what I did.

**1. Training the logic**

I prompted o3 with Russell 3k methodology docs, academic paper (e.g., rebalancing drift) and historical addition/deletion events going back 20 years (pre '08 crash). With a lot of  coaxing and detailed prompting, o3 was able to identify repeatable inclusion rules based on:

* market cap ranking thresholds on rank days
* float-adjusted liquidity metrics
* section diversification heuristics

**2. Candidate screening**

Used codex (chatgpt's coder) to build a scanner in python to predict the likely adds for the index.  Back-tested with python code codex developed, and it show hits for about 70-80%  of adds correctly, 3-4 weeks in advanced.

**3. Trade setup**

Enter additions about 10-20 trading days before announcement.   Exit just before or during rebalance (fade the passive spike).  Of note, there were some healthy signals in deletions, but will maybe it next time.

**4. Execution**

A lot of this is qualitative in nature because of liquidity, crowding, and potential false positives.  A lot of judgment calls here based on individual names, but I was confident in the output from the backtests.

**5. Initial results**

The index rebalanced last Friday, and I went live with some capital and results look good so far.  Haven't closed out the positions but will follow-up with final p&l.

Of note, next year index constitution will move to a semi-annual basis so hopefully double the alpha haha",1751331580.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lookga/i_reverseengineered_russell_3k_index_rebalancing/,investing

Is Innodata the Next Big Winner? DD,"INOD is an American-based AI data engineering company of approximately 1.2 billion market cap. In Q1 2025, it had generated revenue of a huge 120 percent or $58.3 million over Q1 2024. The net income was recorded as 7.8 million, a huge surge since last year during the same period was only one as compared to 7.8 million in the present year. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12.7 million compared to its previous position of 3.8 million and the company ended the quarter with 56.6 million in cash and lack of debts. The management has projected its revenue increase on the closing year by 40%+, based on the blistering AI contract cycle.

The reason Innodata is interesting is that it is the provider of data to large tech companies that are constructing AI and machine learning models. It is projects and new enterprises-scale partnerships at the company that are powered by AI-driven projects. The management said this is the best AI pipeline that they have ever witnessed. Innodata is also operating its business in a cost-effective fashion, with operating costs of about $25 million, generating revenues of about $116 million. The interest of the institutions has been increasing and a recent earnings surprise has given the stock momentum, already 4x since its 2024 lows, with a peak earlier this year near $70.

According to the one-year chart by INOD, the company projects a sharp increase of around 15 dollars in the middle of 2024 to about 70 dollars in the middle of 2025. Despite the slight setback, the 6 12 month picture is nonetheless very positive. Nevertheless, it has dangers. The company depends on a few very large customers and any deceleration in big-tech spending on AI or the loss of a giant deal may affect the outcomes. Moreover, based on the fact that the stock was already hot, its price is already high at a trailing P/E of approximately 12 despite the surge.

  
TL;DR: INOD is a young data company that develops AI-related data services and its revenue grew by 120% last year, with increasing profitability and large partnerships in the field of technology. It is already 4x up since 2024 lows, and possibly could run further in that direction; as long as it continues to perform.

AI-driven retail investing - surprising findings.,"My thesis is that LLMs will revolutionize the way retail invest especially in stocks.

LLMs can be used for idea generation, analysis, thesis validation/testing in social forums, pre-trade, post-trade, monitoring, and even performance attribution.

In fact, I use ChatGPT o3 model for every one of the above.

There are two fundamental issues that still prevents it from becoming mainstream:

1. It has a bad tendency to give the user praise, which often will lead the user to ask the wrong follow-up questions or send them in a bad direction.
2. It has no mechanism to 100% fact-check itself  - yes clever prompting helps - but any analysis, you have to double check as well as references.

I am fortunate to be a CFA charterholder so understand when certain arguments are just plain false.

What is extremely valuable  is that once you have  a framework in mind, you can go through the entire investment process just checking the deductive reasoning, which is quick once you get the hang of it.

It's like having a full-time IB analyst from Goldman on crack, operating at 10x normal speed and doesn't need sleep.

Can someone explain the Carvana nonsense to me?,"It's just not an impressive idea or company. I understand year over year growth is ripping but why such premium valuation? P/E of 118 and fwd p/e at 72. Very low volume and just seems to pump. How is this worth 72 billion? I know it's propped up by institutions, but I'd agree with Hindenburg research that there's a lot of smoke and mirrors. So much corruption and manipulation of numbers, from the outside looking in it's an obvious grift. Will this quarter's earnings be the one where it drops 25% or the next one? Who knows. But I know they aren't special, it's making Tesla look like a buy in comparison LOL 

And ya I have some puts for mid August, doubled down today. Eventually reality will hit (same with Tesla) and the greedy bulls will get what's coming 🙂

"Nice 0DTE SPY scalp for almost $6k, with scaling and exit strategy explained","https://preview.redd.it/e8d52c8l3aaf1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=51db893fb194340fc338c6b79635f0286b15fb69

I keep getting asked about some of the things I am looking for and comments about my ""wild"" scaling in my other posts. So I did this one more by the book to show some of you what I am looking for. As you can see with my purchases, after I decide on a reversal direction @ around 10:30, I go in with 50 contracts. Those almost immediately spiked and I could have been out with 20+% gain on my first purchase, but that would have only been like 6-700 so I was willing to press it. It then fell hard.

I knew the previous V bottom was coming up at 615ish so I averaged down when I was around 20% down. I purchased 2x the amount of already held contracts (50 x 2 = 100) to give myself 150. These fluctuated, but trended down so I again averaged down the same way, 20% down 2x already held. That got me to 450 contracts @ around 0.42 each down just a bit right next to the previous V bottom. This is also my cut off. I don't typically like to do more than 20k on 1 trade. And I am willing to loose up to 30% and take as little as 10% on a win. But when sized up, 10% is still $2k.

As for my exit, on the bounce I knew I would only play this for a short time. This is because the moves up have been rippers today and there is resistance at 617.30ish. So my out was whatever I had when it hit around 617.20ish. That ended up being this win for around 28% or so.

Also, I know I will save money on doing SPX. I just haven't made the transition yet.

$BBAI’s a 🏃‍♂️💨,"Not claiming to be a trading expert, but this BBAI $5 call expiring July 25th has been on fire the past two weeks.

Open interest is strong, IV is rocking at 145%, and delta’s sitting at 0.92.

This is my trade, my decision—not financial advice. I’m just putting it out there in case someone’s looking for ideas. I don’t recommend copying me, but I truly believe that long-term investing in strong plays like this can pay off big time.
