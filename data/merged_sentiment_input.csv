2025-06-23 22:48:09,Any guesses on when MSFT will split shares?,"I‚Äôve been a firm believer that MSFT will split after they hit $500/share. 

I have nothing to base this off of besides peers doing splits in the $400-900 range. 

Amazon, Google and Teslerr were the three peers‚Äô splits that come to mind. 

Disclosure: I have a tiny stake in MSFT but if it‚Äôs splits I may end up with 100 shares, then I‚Äôll sell CCs off into the sunset.

Thoughts on if or when we‚Äôll see a split from MSFT?

2025-06-23 22:40:44,My stocks to beat VOO in next 35 years (2025-2060),"My portfolio will beat the market (VOO)

From now (June 2025) to June 2060, I will have beaten the market with my forever baggers.

I will write three sentences under each, testaments to moat.

           
Jojos Forever Baggers, and comments on each

1. Microsoft ‚Äì 18%

Something that isn‚Äôt talked about enough in regards to Microsoft‚Äôs moat, is the fact that not only businesses obviously, but governments themselves use Microsoft products since the dawn of time (word,excel,access) and this is important, because I see it as a silent, strong aid in protecting against antitrust scrutiny.

2. Amazon ‚Äì 16%

AWS is underestimated. This companies profit potential is under estimated, under appreciated. 

3. Visa ‚Äì 14%

Extreme network effects, and I‚Äôve studied the history of this company and the structure of this company extensively. I love that it‚Äôs a hedge against inflation, naturally through the nature of mass transactions.

4. Nvidia ‚Äì 12%

Bought in at Tariff dip because I saw an opportunity at 100

5. ASML ‚Äì 10%

The bottleneck of AI and digital world. Years ahead of completion. This company has to exist for development of semiconductors.

6. Google (Alphabet) ‚Äì 6%

This narrative that ChatGPT is going to consume the majority of Google Search market share is simple sighted, because Alphabet is a huge fund of companies including Cloud and Waymo, but still, yes 50% of revenues is search. But, search has seen influx after influx. The AI overviews have helped a lot, and Gemini cannot be understated. Locking with new phones and Android software. The market can be simple sighted, because stories in real life can play out in more ways than in these ways etched by fear

7. FICO ‚Äì 5%

Just bought in recently on the bad news.
Companies have long term contracts with FICO,
It‚Äôs very integral to commerce and the landscape of the world. 

8. S&P Global ‚Äì 5%

I can‚Äôt wait for interest rates to drop. When money becomes less expensive to rent, this company will be benefitted drastically. Plausible, and, in my opinion, more likely than not for this to outpace the S and P 500 index itself because their toll can expand quicker than the underlying companies in the index they represent.

9. Berkshire Hathaway ‚Äì 4%

Yes.

10. Mastercard ‚Äì 3%

Same as Visa- network effects, pricing power beyond inflation (Buffets golden rule for moat or durability) and arguably expanding quicker than Visa now.

11. Waste Management ‚Äì 3%

I am familiar with this company, I have seen it my entire life. Speaking from experience after hearing a family member who manages a plumbing store, Waste Management has an apparent infrastructural monopoly on trash. Possibly one of the most logistical companies of all time. Trash is a constant, but this, along with McDonalds is a slight tweak towards wealth preservation over accumulation.

12. McDonald‚Äôs ‚Äì 2%

Biggest real estate trust in the world, as they own many of the most valuable properties in the entire commercial and noncommercial world. People are addicted, and it‚Äôs a staple of, not just American culture, but modern culture.

2025-06-23 20:26:46,Tesla Robotaxi goes live  stock rockets TSLA will continue to rise   or is it going cold?,"Fellow TSLA observers, checking in  As you may have seen  Tesla made big news recently: self-driving cabs (Robotaxi) officially went live in Austin charging only $4.20 per order (yup  Musk is playing the game again) 

On June 23rd, Tesla launched a trial run of Robotaxi in Austin  Texas Pricing is $4.20 per order  and it still has a human safety officer sitting in the car  but it has already begun to pay for external operations News As soon as the news came out Tesla stock spiked 8-10% straight up in pre-market to close near $348-$350 for the day 

Is TSLA up or down?

So far: TSLA is still running high  shares around $349. 8%+ one-day spike after Robotaxi

Year-to-date: while cumulative year-to-date is still in the -7% to -14% range (depending on where you start)  shares have rallied 35-40% since Robotaxi news

Reasons for the rally: 

Significant inflection point: this is the first step in making real money from Autopilot  This is the first step for autonomous driving to start making real money  there are still safeties, but this is a major breakthrough 

Valuation: UBS raised their price target from $190 to $215 (though still cautious) Cathie Wood continues to be bullish as well 

Macro-help: the Fed has become more dovish, and the overall broader market is optimistic  which also gives room for the rally to continue



Will it continue to rise or will it be prototyped?

Has the positive sentiment been overdrawn? UBS thinks Robotaxi's upside may have factored in a \~$99 share price premium 

Regulatory risk: Texas has made it clear that licenses are required by September, and there have already been some fines for non-compliance 

Musk risk: public opinion swirls  protesters  and political pressures are all over the place Investors can easily get scared 

Valuation is still expensive: even if it's profitable now, TSLA is still trading at a valuation of 170x 2025 expected profits. It's already outrageous 

TSLA is currently trading around $349 with intraday volume of \~176 million shares The trading range of $323-$357.5 is approaching the technical pressure level of $360-$370 

In a nutshell: the launch of Robotaxi is indeed a big positive The stock has surged by about 8-10%  Currently oscillating at $349 but a lot of the good has already been reflected 

Long view: this is a real turning point  Revenue modeling, branding, voice, and execution are all perfect scores  If technology and regulation keep up  it could continue to fly

Short view: valuation is too high  public opinion is too risky, and policy is too unstable  so it's not uncommon for the market to sell the news at any time  so it's not uncommon to see the market go higher



Do you think Robotaxi is a real long term change or a short term hype?

Anyone planning to wait for a pullback ($320-330) before getting in? Or are you ready to dump at $360?",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lirftv/tesla_robotaxi_goes_live_stock_rockets_tsla_will/

This is still a company growing at more than 100% per year at 40x forward earnings. The Trump administration will continue to deregulate across the board, so I don‚Äôt believe their core business model is at risk for at least the next 3 years. Macro liquidity is going higher along with HIMS continuing to be a retail favorite. This is an opportunity to buy a market leader at a significant discount. Could it go lower? Absolutely, but in my mind the likelihood of this stock making significant new highs this year is quite good.

2025-06-23 17:06:03,Is the Hims selloff overblown,"The company has seen its stock decline by 34% (as of writing) after the cancellation of NVO partnership. 

GLP brought in 200m of 1.5b revenue last year so about 15% of total revenues. Is the 30%+ decline for a product that'll still pull in revenues and see an impact of 10ish% max to the company warrant this fall?

Perhaps the rationale is that NVO knows something about upcoming regulation against selling compound GLP products. Or perhaps NVO partnership brought a lot of legitimacy and customers who signed up to get access to Wegovy which will churn. 

Anyways is anybody eyeing the stock now that it's fallen so much for a relatively contained revenue drop? ",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lim5r9/is_the_hims_selloff_overblown/

**Thought:**¬†I like looking at indirect impact points in addition to traditional technicals. Example - I keep an eye on are on Fedex/UPS earnings calls for retail forecasts (shipping volume directly proportional to sales numbers), banking earnings for understanding liquidity, credit availability, and investment returns etc. and not wait for formal readings like CPI etc to post.

**Target:**¬†I have a SPY target of 550 to 600 for July 2026.

**Discussion points:**

* **Inflation**¬†has not hit the economy yet, but this weeks earnings will start showing hints of it.
* Inflation if not controlled can impact¬†**liquidity**¬†(can impact 401k contributions, DCA contributions etc...)
* **War is never cheap**¬†and thought it can give short term bursts of boosts to stock markets with rumors.
* **Debt**¬†is good until it is within means - i.e. Debt < GDP
* **Risk fatigue is real**¬†\- Your month on month contributions are being blindly invested in those target funds without risk readings taken into considerations and rug pulls are not uncommon.

2025-06-23 13:47:17,Opportunities in the short-term market volatility? I'm sharing a low-risk offensive strategy that I've been tracking recently,"Over the past few weeks, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, ""The direction is unclear and we dare not act."" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.

Recently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:

After determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.

Place an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).

Auxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.

Last week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.

I wouldn't say this is a ""sure-win strategy"", but its advantage lies in:

The risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage

It‚Äôs not just the FAA now, they‚Äôre trying to line things up globally, which could be a huge advantage if they‚Äôre first

They‚Äôve also got their first Midnight deliveries scheduled for this summer in the UAE ***(Abu Dhabi Aviation + Ethiopian Airlines),*** and just announced a new software partnership with Palantir to build out aviation systems. So it looks like they‚Äôre stacking the pieces: hardware, software, and regulatory.

Financials are still rough, last quarter they reported a $93M net loss, but they‚Äôve got over $1B in cash and just raised another $850M. So runway isn‚Äôt the issue right now. The bigger question is how fast they can move from testing to actual paid operations.

Still zero revenue, obviously, but the article points out they‚Äôre leading the sector and up over 220% in the last year. Volatile, but seems like they‚Äôre ahead of the other players in terms of actual execution.

The partnership, which was expanded just last month in April, had aimed to make obesity treatments more accessible and affordable for Americans.

>According to Novo Nordisk, the decision comes after Hims & Hers allegedly failed to comply with laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs. The pharmaceutical company accused the telehealth provider of ""disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk.""

>""Novo Nordisk is firm on our position and protecting patients living with obesity,"" said Dave Moore, Executive Vice President of US Operations at Novo Nordisk. ""When patients are prescribed semaglutide treatments by their licensed healthcare professional or a telehealth provider, they are entitled to receive authentic, FDA-approved and regulated Wegovy.""

>The original collaboration, announced in April, had offered Americans access to Wegovy through the Hims & Hers platform at a unified price starting at $599 per month, which included the medication along with 24/7 care, clinical support, and nutrition guidance.

>Novo Nordisk expressed concerns about ""knock-off drugs"" made with foreign ingredients, specifically citing suppliers from China that have not been authorized by the FDA to manufacture semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy.

For context, I recently finished college and have started working. I‚Äôm in the 24% tax bracket and my CPA and I aren‚Äôt too worried about me getting into the 32% bracket. I have one full time job that gives me a W-2 and a contract job that gives me a 1099. 

The problem is that my W-2 job won‚Äôt allow in service 401K conversions making it not possible to convert it into a roth IRA at least while i‚Äôm still working there. I‚Äôm hoping that setting up a solo 401K with a company (i.e., vangaurd or fidelity) that allows in service conversions will allow me to contribute and convert more than $7000 a year to my Roth IRA. 

My CPA has advised that I also write off as many expenses as I can from my contract job as the self-employment tax is quite high. He also stated that the maximum I can contribute to my solo 401K is only 20% of whatever my net income from the contract job is meaning if I make $20,000 from my contract job a year I can only contribute and then convert $4000 (not taking into account the tax on that $4000). He is not sure if I can take my after-tax money from my W-2 job contribute as an after-tax contribution to my solo 401K. He is under the impression that it can only be the wages gained from my contract job. He was also worried about me maxing out my 401K at my W2 job and contributing to my solo 401K at the same time, but if I‚Äôm trying to convert everything in my solo 401K it should be fine?

He‚Äôs going to do more research before getting back to me. I was doing research through the White Coat Investor so I believe it is possible. I just want to see if anyone else has done this or has any comments/advice to offer. I hope to cross check what my CPA says when he gets back to me in a couple weeks.

Basically, they've been given until 2027 to remove 40 substances - including bleached flour and artificial dyes.

What hit me was that High Fructose Corn Syrup did not make the warnings list. This wasn't because it was healthy - HCFS was formerly banned by the EU and UK but came off the list in 2017 (probs because of healthy lobbying by Big Sugar (21.3m euros at the last count, not because the EU 'finally saw the light). 

But what also hit me is the warnings in Texas WILL be followed by the same in 49 other states (in my view), because states don't want to be seen as encouraging people to eat like s\*\*t, and they are worried about RFKJ and his mad campaign to make everyone better again.

So then what about the shares in $KO and $PEP? With this stuff AS WELL as worries in the Middle East, it is a definitely worrying trend for me. Or am I simply worrying for worry's sake, bearing in mind the stock's still up 10% YTD and people will always go to their crappy products for comfort food in times like this.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lidh6b/ko_pep_and_the_new_texas_health_labels/

My wife got a small inheritance recently, so we put in about USD 20k last month. I just got a work bonus, so have another USD 30k to put in. I placed the orders on Saturday, in my usual passive funds, as is my way. However, when the US bombed Iran, I cancelled the orders, thinking markets would dip today - with the aim of buying the dip. However, there is no big dip, but there could still be. Or they could not be. This is getting close to 'timing the market', and I'm more of a 'time in the market' sort of guy. Should I simply stick to my plan and chuck it in? I know timing the dip is extremely hard - I held off a bit buying the dip on the tariff related downturn and missed a lot of upside.

2025-06-23 03:23:18,"Why EQT will benefit from AI, Iran War, and Trump Tariffs","EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the U.S.

Not going to bore you with financial metrics, so I will keep this thesis concise.

1. Natural gas is the primary marginal fuel for U.S. power generation, which will support AI datacenter expansion (not nuclear, at least this decade).
2. Roughly 20% of global LNG flows through the Strait of Hormuz. Any disruption could drive up global LNG prices, pulling more U.S. supply into export markets and tightening domestic balances - bullish for Henry Hub and EQT‚Äôs unhedged volumes.
3. Trump-era policy was broadly favorable to fossil fuels. While tariffs could pressure steel-intensive capex (e.g., pipelines), the trade-off is likely faster permitting, LNG approvals, and pro-drilling rhetoric.
4. EQT‚Äôs disciplined hedging strategy, strong capital return framework, and ongoing basis risk from pipeline constraints shape its risk/reward profile - limiting upside in price spikes, but providing stable cash flow and shareholder returns.

It's one of the best plays on U.S. gas demand growth, geopolitical optionality, and Trumpian regulatory shifts.

2025-06-22 23:19:13,Is It Actually Moral and Good to Invest In Evil Companies?,"There is an assumption for most people that ethical investing involves not investing in companies that one deems (personally) immoral. The types of companies one deems immoral will be different for every investor, but is not important for this question. Question is: For someone that cares about a certain issue, is it actually *better* to invest in that company, reap the rewards, and then use the rewards for your cause, than to not invest at all?

  
For example, let's say your biggest issue is climate change. If you invest, let's say, $1K in Exxon Mobil, the benefit to Exxon is essentially *nil*\---you are buying the stock from another person, not the company; the only real impact is a totally negligible increase to the share price (I guess... And I guess of like a theoretical 0.00000000000000000000001%?). A few years later, you sell your investment, which is now worth $1.5K. With the $500 profit, you can donate to a green energy non-profit, use the money to help buy solar panels, etc..---direct forms of support which almost certainly have a much greater positive effect than the buying of the stock had a negative effect. So essentially you are buying a stock from someone (who is probably pro-fossil fuels, and whose consumption patterns would probably align to that---i.e., would use the money they make to make the problem even worse) and now having it be owned by yourself, who will take the increased valuation of this company over time and use it *against them* at a much higher impact multiplier.

  
What are the problems with this argument? I'm not sure I totally agree with it, but I currently find it at least as persuasive as the ""investing in bad stock = bad because complicit"" argument.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1li1m2h/is_it_actually_moral_and_good_to_invest_in_evil/

The loan is $500,000 total, and I would receive that amount at the inception of the loan. 1/5 of the loan would be forgiven each year for the next five years, assuming I'm still employed at the company. The loan has an interest rate that is equal to the lowest interest rate permitted by the IRS for an 5-year term arm's length loan (currently about 4%), and the accrued interest to date would be forgiven each year in the same manner as the corresponding principal amount as described above. Every time a tranche of the loan is forgiven, I have to pay taxes on the forgiven amount at that time, which is taxed as ordinary income.

.

The substantial risk here is that if I leave the company (or am laid off) during the term of the loan, I have to pay back the non-forgiven principal and interest accrued to date within 30 days. So I need to be pretty liquid with the investment. The goal is therefore to meet or beat the 4% interest rate (ideally, post-tax) but maintain at least pretty good liquidity.

.

In the immediate term, my candidate solution is to invest in individual municipal bonds with a maturity date right before the first tranche of the loan is forgiven (in about a year). Current rates on such municipal bonds I'm seeing are roughly 5%, and they are not subject to federal income taxes, which is a substantial perk. When those bonds mature, I would reassess and probably lean towards reinvesting the proceeds in municipal bonds again with about a one year term.

.

There is liquidity risk in that I could be compelled to repay the loan before those municipal bonds mature, but there are three considerations that mitigate this:

(1) I think it's very unlikely I would separate or be separated from the company within the next six months. Probably if I am separated from the company, the most likely time would be as we approach the date of the first tranche being forgiven.

(2) Municipal bonds can be sold on the secondary market, so I could liquidate early if necessary. Granted, if interest rates go up (and that seems likely!), I might have to sell at a loss, but the volatility here is less than the stock market.

(3) I have the capacity to liquidate other stock investments and/or take out short-term loans (e.g. until the bonds mature) to repay the loan if necessary.

.

So, thoughts? Can you come up with a better solution? It's an interesting problem and not one that I've been able to find much about online. Thank you!",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1li0iw9/investing_a_substantial_forgivable_loan_liquidity/

* **Starting balance**: $395,340.74 (What I've accumulated the last 8.5 - 9 years).
* **Starting salary**: $91,500 (In addition to employer match of 5% and salary base increase of 2% annually)
* **Annual contribution**: $23,500
* **Annual return**: 7%

I'll contribute for 25 years, then let time and returns carry my portfolio through the final 8 years.

|72|**$23,125,326**|**$12,648,090**|**$6,866,508**|

**Summary**:

Just for context: I could adjust this for inflation or make it conservative at even 5%-6%, but the numbers are encouraging IF things stay the way they are. I plan to start Roth conversions in my personal Roth IRA at 60 and hopefully will help minimize large tax bill and remain in a desirable tax bracket by then.

2025-06-22 18:14:37,Advice about ethical investing?,"
So, for context, I‚Äôm from Spain and almost 30. I started investing around two years ago, when I didn‚Äôt really know how it worked. My biggest investment was my current house, which I bought for around 200,000‚Ç¨, and I‚Äôve also put some money into the stock market sporadically (around 3,000‚Ç¨ total), investing in the classics like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Coca-Cola, by buying individual stocks through Revolut, not funds or ETFs. 

I never invested in Tesla, Netflix, and some other companies because they go against my values (Elon Musk, subscription services, gas or arms companies, etc.). But over time, I‚Äôve realized that many of the companies I have invested in don‚Äôt align with my morals either, especially after some of them publicly supported Trump (Meta, Amazon, etc.) or Israel (Carrefour, McDonald‚Äôs, and many more).

Now I‚Äôm dealing with an internal conflict. I want to make money, but not by supporting unethical companies. I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of funds and ETFs also include these companies in different proportions, and the ones that don‚Äôt often don‚Äôt perform well. So it‚Äôs hard to find ways to invest that feel both profitable and principled.

I guess my questions are: how do you align your values with your investments? Do you think there‚Äôs a middle ground, and if so, how do you find it? Do you have any recommendations for specific companies, funds, or ETFs that are both ethical and profitable? Or would it make more sense to put the money into a high-yield savings account, crypto, gold, or something else?

All feedback is welcome.

2025-06-22 15:33:44,$60K on TSLA Puts:  Why TSLA Will Be Down Big Next Few Weeks.,"In no particular order:

- Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely a sell-the-news event anyways.

- Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks.  TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money.

- TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September.  This is a huge precedent which now means TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods.  Waymo will continue to expand faster than TSLA.

- Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings.  Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world.  Analyst downgrades are coming.  TSLA will likely lower full year guidance.

- I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond.  It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars.

- Elon is still popping off about one of Mango‚Äôs closest White House aides.  The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant.

- $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year.

- Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further.  High P/E stocks like TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.

How‚Äôs it going for you?,"Hi all, I‚Äôm in my late 20s, working a pretty standard tech job (did a few years in retail before that). Sometime last year, I was fortunate enough to receive a mid to high 5 figure inheritance from family. At first, I let the bank‚Äôs advisors handle it, but honestly the returns were pretty underwhelming. So I decided to start learning on the side on my own. Taught myself the basics of investing, lots of youTube, books and lurking on this sub haha.

Fast forward to a year now, and I‚Äôve managed to grow my little inheritance to just over six figures. Nothing crazy, but I‚Äôm pretty proud considering I started with zero experience and just learned as I went. I‚Äôm still keeping things pretty conservative (mostly index funds, some blue-chip stocks, and a bit of crypto for fun).

My main goal is to save up for a down payment on a property in the next few years, so I‚Äôm trying to balance growth with not taking on too much risk.

Curious if anyone else here is in a similar boat, either got a windfall, received an inheritance or just decided to take the DIY route with their investments. How‚Äôs it going for you? How long have you been managing your own portfolio, and what‚Äôs been your biggest lesson so far?

2025-06-22 04:03:00,Historical Prices vs Historical Performance Claims,"I need some help on the stock system as a whole. I'm doing some research on stock price history. 

In the period from 1980 to 1990, several stocks were considered ""best performers"", including USB, Circuit City, Nike, and some others. Nike is listed as having a 23,000% return. Circuit City was supposed to have a 90x return. USB is listed as a 22,000% return. 

But when I review the historical prices... I don't see where those returns come from. 

Take USB:  
Jan 1980 price about $0.70   
Dec 1989 price about $2.35 (3x increase)

Stock splits  
1984 1.1 for 1  
1985 2 for 1  
1989 2 for 1 (roughly 5.5x cumulative)

All that together is roughly a 1500% return. 

There are dividends, roughly quarterly. So that might account for it. Some are into the forty cents a share and some are not even a dime per share. 

NIKE is even worse though.   
Jan 1981 price about $0.16  
Dec 1989 price about $0.87 (5.5x increase)

1x 2:1 stock split in the entire decade

6x $0.10 and 1x $0.15 dividend the entire decade. 

How does anyone get a 23000% return from that?

My current situation is 38 year old with ~$600,000 in investments between 401k, Roth IRA, Crypto, brokerage, HSA, and HYSA.  Currently I'm fortunate enough to max out my 401k, Roth IRA for myself and spouse, max HSA, and have some extra I put into brokerage accounts monthly. Also we have a primary residence with a mortgage at 3.375% interest, current mortgage value is around 50% of current home vaule.

I'm trying to decide on of I should sell the inherited home and take the lump sum to invest in brokerage or keep the house as a rental property.  Based on my numbers I think I have to get a new mortgage on the rental property around $120,000 to do some home improvements before it's ready to rent.  Expected rent would be around $1,800-$1,900 and I would prefer to use a property management company to stay as hands off as I could.

My mind is telling me it's be good to keep property as a rental for future passive income and maybe the first stepping stone into a few rentals down the line.  However it's hard for me to not just take the lump sum and grow it at 7%-10% per year in the market.

A sizable amount of her portfolio was recently invested in a very new ""actively managed fund"" that I had never heard of, ticker FFOX.

Upon further inspection, there are a few odd things that jumped out:  
\- 1% Expense Ratio.  
\- Nearly half of the fund is just a collection of other ETFs.  
\- It is owned and managed by the same wealth management company.  
\- The expense ratio is buried way at the bottom of the fund‚Äôs site, and holdings are listed alphabetically (so it‚Äôs easy to miss that most of the fund is just other ETFs).

After I learned this, I asked my girlfriend to get in touch with her parents, who use the same wealth management company, and it turns out they also have a chunky amount of money invested in this fund. Neither of them were informed about this move.

This strikes me as a massive conflict of interest, and straight up shady business practice.

2025-06-21 13:58:21,What are the best companies to benefit from increased power/grid demand?,"AI demand is already producing strain on existing grid and power plants. Fairfax county VA recently passed restrictions on new data centers due to partially due to concerns related to energy demands and grid stability. No matter what though new AI GPUs and data centers will require more and more electricity. EVs will also require more power consumption as their market share increases. There is also going to be some demand for heat pumps replacing oil/gas furnaces particularly in the Northeast and Midwest.  

It seems like no matter what there will need to be billions spent on the grid regionally and nationally for the reasons above. Which companies will benefit the most from this? Looking at either companies that either sell large amounts of raw materials provided or that sell unique components/services that grid providers will need and pay a premium for.

Unfortunately I failed to understand at the time the difference between Accumulated and Distributed ETFs (and still unsure whether I get it). 

29% of my portfolio is allocated into Vanguard S&P 500 Distributed ETFs

also, 4% onto a Emerging Markets Distributed ETF.

  
Am I not losing out completely on the compounding effect by holding on to these ETFs or do I misunderstand how it works? Should I transfer that money/position to the Accumulated version of those ETFs so those dividends get reinvested automatically onto the ETF?

2025-06-20 13:51:15,Tesla Robotaxi Launch: We Were All Wrong (and VW has one now),"I made a speculative post about how Phony Stark would delay the Robotaxi launch and there were lots of other good guesses on how they would fake it (ala- human in a robot suit tactics). We had things like relays back to HQ to operate them like drones, tail cars, AI (actually Indians), and other ways humans would operate them. Well... It looks like they are going to go through with it and it's even worse than we all thought. They are just going to put a human operator inside the cars! Not kidding...

Source: [https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/](https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/)

I am going to need to see a picture of the passenger side floorboard. If they don't put a physical brake pedal in there like all the drivers ed cars have retrofitted in them, you know the human operator will have something like a game controller or button on them to apply the brakes. Classic Elon and Tesla.

Given that the only people riding in these Roboscams are known Tesler fanboys that were invited because of their past posts on X, I am sure the reviews will be nothing short of fantastic. Here is one I can foresee:

""*I felt perfectly safe riding in the awesome new Tesla Robotaxi! The ride was so smooth. I barely felt the bump when we ran over the little kid getting off the school bus and it didn't delay my trip at all after the AI just kept us going.*""

In other news: VW, without feeling the need to spread propaganda ahead of time, just unveiled their production ID. Buzz AD robotaxi. Yeah. That small car company. And it's awesome.

Along with being an actual purpose design and built robotaxi instead of just a Jerrry-rigged older model, it has three things Tesla doesn't:

1. Nine LiDAR sensors (and five radars- so it doesn't crash into things).
2. Space for actual passengers- a key feature to taxis.
3. Level 4 autonomy.

I love the Tesla fan perspective on LiDAR: ""It's expensive"" and ""It's not needed with an AI-driven 100% vision system"". Yeah right. Let's see it work then. We've only been waiting a decade now. If Tesla can solve all of the world's hardest technological problems and are the world's best at manufacturing (as Elon states), then why can't they design and build their own simple LiDAR sensors for their cars? They can't make a better version of the sensor I can buy online for a few hundred bucks that goes into a golf range finder but they are going to make a humanoid robot? One of those things is really hard to do. The other isn't.

Tesla is so far behind in this space. I can't believe there are still enough gullible people still falling for the narrative to pump the stock. Their own internal analysis said this endeavor would lose money. At this point I think there are only three types of people:

1. Aware.
2. Blind Believers (aka- cult members).
3. Traders that are aware of the believers and make money off the stock because of them.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lg4ifl/tesla_robotaxi_launch_we_were_all_wrong_and_vw/
