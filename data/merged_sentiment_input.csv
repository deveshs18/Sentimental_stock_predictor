2025-08-01 21:08:25,Done with options. Put my last $79k to my name in Apple shares.,"My account was once worth over $200,000. I got addicted, lost all motivation, and stopped applying myself at work. I‚Äôm thinking about seeking counseling, but right now all I can focus on is this loss. I know others have faced even bigger setbacks, but I genuinely need some motivation or support‚ÄîI feel like a total failure. At one point, I truly believed I‚Äôd become great at this.

The depression has fully caught up with me, and I‚Äôll be honest: I had ambitious plans and managed to save a lot of money, but I blew through it carelessly. No one in my life knows this because I hate the idea of people worrying about me‚Äîit only reinforces the thoughts already overwhelming my mind.

My family and friends think I‚Äôm well off. But I‚Äôll be honest, I most likely need to sell a lot of my belongings. I put on weight, and I have lost all discipline to do anything it seems.

2025-08-01 21:01:27,33k full-port YOLO on a bunch of rock suckers ($TMC),"This stock has been good to me this year. I was in at $2.50 for the spring run up but got out too early and have been waiting for a decent re-entry. This evening it arrived on a silver platter.

Shareholders have been waiting for two things- the feasibility study and approval to start collecting deep sea minerals. 

The CEO tweeted late in the day to say the feasibility study will be released on Monday morning, and hinted at more news to follow later in the week. A large green candle arrived right on cue. 

I originally YOLO'd the 8/8 5c because there was unusual call buying activity on them a couple of hours before the tweet, but then I had flashbacks of past YOLOs gone wrong, remembered risk management was a thing and went for much more conservative 125x Feb 26 4C.

This has been doing its thing around $7-8 recently, so I would imagine it'll get back up there at the least on a good feasibility study. I won't speculate on the other news but I would imagine it's good if the CEO is teasing it. 

Oh, for the more sophisticated regard who likes to know what a company does rather than copy/pasting the ticker and mashing the buy button, they suck rocks out of the sea for money.

2025-08-01 21:00:20,Funds to diversify? 21 year old,"Hey,

I‚Äôm 21 years old from the UK, please bare this in mind as some funds eg VXUS aren‚Äôt available to me. Currently have most of my money in S&P vuag in T212 and will continue to do so. I hold 4 individual other stocks which I plan to hold for 5-10 years (Microsoft, Visa, Alphabet A, Rolls-Royce). 

I would like a fund or two to diversify a little more away from just this, but only to put a little in - I still want the majority 90% ish of my portfolio to be in S&P, so please don‚Äôt recommend switching to all world funds, thank you. I understand they have a large % in us anyway but I‚Äôd rather not switch. 

I want to diversify a little into emerging markets and developed economies excluding US. The two funds I am looking at purchasing are - ishares EMIM, and XMWX world ex USA. Please could you let me know your thoughts on this. And if you have any better recommendations- aside from switching to an all world fund. 

I am also interested in putting some into BRKB, as I still believe in the firm post Buffett, and their cash reserves and steady growth feel like a safe long term bet. Thoughts on this too?

My question is - how common is it to mitigate forex risks by future options of buying USD at sone price?

2025-08-01 19:01:02,"The deal with Uranium, iridium, plutonium, and rare earth elements (REEs)","Uranium, iridium, plutonium, and rare earth elements (REEs) are becoming more important in energy, defense, and advanced technology. These materials are key to nuclear power, electric vehicles, space systems, and military hardware. With global tensions rising and countries aiming to reduce their reliance on foreign supply chains, U.S. and Canadian companies are stepping in to meet demand.

In the U.S., nuclear energy is making a comeback, driving growth in domestic uranium mining. Energy Fuels (UUUU) leads uranium production and also processes rare earth elements at its White Mesa Mill in Utah. Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) holds one of the largest physical uranium stockpiles in the U.S. and operates projects in Texas and Wyoming. BWX Technologies (BWXT) is not a miner but supports U.S. defense and space programs with nuclear systems, giving it indirect exposure to plutonium.

On the rare earths side, MP Materials (MP) runs the Mountain Pass mine in California, the only major rare earth mine in the U.S., and is working to build domestic refining capacity. Although the U.S. does not produce iridium, the metal is essential in hydrogen fuel technology, making its supply relevant to America‚Äôs clean energy goals.

Canada remains a global uranium powerhouse, mainly due to its rich Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan. Cameco (CCO.TO / CCJ:NYSE) is the top Canadian uranium producer with major long-term contracts worldwide. Developers like NexGen Energy (NXE.TO / NXE:NYSE) and Denison Mines (DML.TO) are progressing high-grade projects, while Fission Uranium (FCU.TO) is preparing its Patterson Lake South site for future production.

Plutonium is not part of commercial markets but plays a critical role in national security and space exploration. Companies like BWX Technologies support the infrastructure behind these programs in the U.S.

With increasing global competition over critical minerals, both the U.S. and Canadian governments are investing in mining and processing capabilities. That puts companies like Cameco, MP Materials, Energy Fuels, Uranium Energy Corp, and Denison Mines in a strong position as essential suppliers for the future of energy and defense.

The payout includes $129 million in compensatory damages, and $200 million in punitive damages against Tesla. Attorneys for the plaintiffs had asked the jury to award damages of around $345 million. The trial in the Southern District of Florida started on July 14.

The suit centered around who shouldered the blame for the deadly crash in Key Largo, Florida. A¬†Tesla¬†owner named George McGee was driving his Model S electric sedan while using the company‚Äôs Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system.

While driving, McGee dropped his mobile phone that he was using and scrambled to pick it up. He said during the trial that he believed Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. His Model S accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, hitting a nearby empty parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle.

Naibel Benavides, who was 22, died on the scene from injuries sustained in the crash. Her body was discovered about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury and psychological effects.

2025-08-01 17:08:16,Am I putting too much faith in high dividend stocks?,"I'm a temporary worker in the US and only have about 5-6years to actively invest here. Over the last 1 year I've invested around 4k into VOO and 2k in ETH and BTC. I usually save around $500 a month to invest, this is after having 20k saved up in a HYSA. 

Last month I invest 1k into various yieldmax stocks. They're all high dividend stocks that have been paying 80-90% distributions for the past couple of years. The monthly distribution return from them was as expected and I reinvested the dividend back. My plan is to increase this dividend portfolio to around 5k, while keeping my VOO contributions going on.

Looking at the trend and my saving/investment capacity, I feel like in a year I'll be able to reach 5k and that would mean around 350-400 a month in dividend yield. That is when I plan on diverting this into my VOO contribution, effectively doubling the current pace. I am aware of the tax implications of dividends and I feel like since my dividend yield is so low compared to bigger investors, I can easily absorb it.

I know the stock market is not without risks, NAV erosion can occur, but the underlying stocks in these dividend ETFs are all performing well and I feel will continue to do so, hence I don't really see any pitfalls in this strategy considering this is going to be at most a 3-4 year plan. Although, being a novice investor, I wanted to ask this here, hoping to uncover and avoid any risks that I'm oblivious to.

2025-08-01 16:33:10,"State of U.S. Tariffs: August 1, 2025","The Budget Lab (TBL) estimated the effects all US tariffs and foreign retaliation implemented in 2025 through July 31, including the new list of ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs to take effect August 7. TBL analyzed the July 31 tariff rates as if they stayed in effect in perpetuity.

Current Tariff Rate: Consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.3%, the highest since 1934. After consumption shifts, the average tariff rate will be 17.3%, the highest since 1935.

Overall Price Level & Distributional Effects: The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 1.8% in the short-run, the equivalent of an average per household income loss of $2,400 in 2025$. This assumes the Federal Reserve does not react to tariffs and so the real income adjustment comes primarily through prices rather than nominal incomes; if the Federal Reserve reacted, the adjustment could in part come in the form of lower nominal incomes. Annual pre-substitution losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are $1,300. The post-substitution price increase settles at 1.5%, a $2,000 loss per household.

Commodity Prices: The 2025 tariffs disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with consumers facing 40% higher shoe prices and 38% higher apparel prices in the short-run. Shoes and apparel prices stay 19% and 17% higher in the long-run respectively.

Real GDP Effects: US real GDP growth over 2025 and 2026 is -0.5pp lower each year from all 2025 tariffs. In the long-run, the US economy is persistently -0.4% smaller, the equivalent of $120 billion annually in 2024$.

Labor Market Effects: The unemployment rate rises 0.3 percentage point by the end of 2025 and 0.7 percentage point by the end of 2026. Payroll employment is 497,000 lower by the end of 2025.

Long-Run Sectoral GDP & Employment Effects: In the long-run, tariffs present a trade-off. US manufacturing output expands by 2.1%, but these gains are more than crowded out by other sectors: construction output contracts by 3.5% and agriculture declines by 0.9%.

Fiscal Effects: All tariffs to date in 2025 raise $2.7 trillion over 2026-35, with $466 billion in negative dynamic revenue effects, bringing dynamic revenues to $2.2 trillion.

RSI low. Earnings in two weeks. If they beat again (like Q1), this thing could explode. If not, I don‚Äôt see a huge downside from here unless the world collapses.

Worst case? I lose a bit on a solid company.
Best case? This gets re-rated fast and I look like a genius.
Risk/reward just makes too much sense.

2025-08-01 15:31:14,6 year bear market starting - It's 2007 all over again - One more ATH then massive bear market.,"Today's August pull back is just like the 2007 playbook, but why? It has to do with bond market positioning. The more ""bullish"" bonds become the more strain it puts on the market and because the economy is running on fumes and surviving by ""wealth effect"" that's why bond market rallies look like they happen because of recessions.

It's really the other way around.

In 2007, the bond market began to rally around July/August in anticipation of the first rate cut which was September 2007. The market made an ATH in July/August and then one more in December 2007.

That was the end for the next 6 years. The Market wouldn't see that ATH again until 2013.

The key points are that this post isn't because of a market dip today, I been saying I was short for weeks now.

The point is that the bond market will drive a severe recession as it is a giant ocean of money.

You think the S&P 500 composite represents a large market cap? It's a pond compared to the bond market.

When the bond market becomes bullish, it'll drain so much money out of the S&P that it will make all you perma-bulls look like perma-foo0Is.

And this is a problem that's decently well understood, so it's traded, and you're seeing that pattern play out tit-for-tat. Go overlay the current bull-rally pattern over the 2007 pattern and you'll see it's fairly similar.

It's because the bond market is getting ready to move. And when money flows into it, the rest of the entire economy will starve, unemployment goes up, foreclosures go up, repos go up, and no one will have spare money to buy stocks.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mezl5u/6_year_bear_market_starting_its_2007_all_over/

2025-08-01 15:14:40,A simple value investing strategy for the retail investor : Diversified portfolio with chances to beat the market,"After losing money with trading, bad decisions and temperamental buy or sell given by Twitter influencers, blind recommendations, leaverage and other errors, I decided some months ago to begin to use only value investing. Value investing was the reason why I originally began to invest but in the first 1.5 years I took bad decisions.

My strategy is based on the following books :

1. One up on wall street 
2. The little book that beats the market 
3. Acquirer‚Äôs Multiple 
4. Warren buffet accounting book( don't remember the exact name) 
I also implement other tips and suggestions made in reddit and scientific articles. The strategy doesn't aim to be the best but to have peace of mind, be simple to implement with good potential researched and story backed to beat the market. 




1.Screener :

The first step for a retail investor to invest without much time is to get a list of the best 100 stocks. There are many ways to do this. Based on my readings and research there are different screener thst can give stocks that can beat the market. They are all implemented with tradingview 

1.1 Magic formula: In this one we want to have a low EV/EBIT but with high ROIC. Instead of the classical ranking, for an easy and practical implementation, I just insert good values thst give me 100 stocks. Roic is over 30% and ev/EBIT is under 8. 

1.2 Acquirer‚Äôs Multiple : In this one we only use ev/EBIT but I also add some small weight on roic. This is a magic formula essentially with heavier weight on the ev/EBIT. Roic here is over 8% while ev/ebit is under 3

1.3 Conservative formula : Here we screen based on momentum first, given by stocks that increased price over 15% last 12 months. Then we also want to have low volatility. Instead of using 3 year volatility, here I use a beta of 3 years lower than 0.9 and a 1M volatility lower than 3%. The last step is to add high payout yield. Here I prefer buyback than dividend with over 3% buyback and over 1% dividend. You can change this but minimum yield should be 4% Always

1.4 Motley fool value and growth : Here we use a combination of factors that I can tell more in detail later as it's long. The idea is to combine Peg under 1 (favourite Lynch indicator) with growth indicators. The growth indicators are mainly high Eps, low inventories, low debt and others. This is close to Lynch strategy with some more weight to growth and it has worked very well recently. 

1.5 A custom portfolio : Based on the recent ones and lynch recommendations I made a portfolio that balance all the previous recommendations (without the Motley) to give 100 stocks best. However this is balanced but can be flawed in some aspects. 


2. A good strategy to select stocks to buy :

After you screen 100 stocks (or 500 stocks with all screeners together) using all markets you want. In my case usa, Europe and Asia. The next thing is to choose what stock you buy. For this I developed a check list (following Charlie munger recommendations). The checklist will have several categories : Financial health, relative valuation, DCF and quantitative measurements. To buy a stock, it must pass with 0 points or more each category. To each individual subcategory we will give points - 1, 0 or 1. 

2.1 Financial health: A company must be financially healthy. The first step is to get over 0 points here. There are 2 things we will use. Low debt /equity and high F-score. If you want you can use debt /assets. 

2.2 Relative valuation: This is the biggest category and the one I like the most. We are retail so we need something simple, a number we can look at. Here we want high roic, high fcf yield, low ev/ebit, low peg, roic over average of industry, good pe vs historial average, good lynch fair value, high net and gross margins, margins better than industry average, higher eps revisions compared to analysts in last quarters. 

2.3 DCF: discounted cash flow is hard and main reason why we do formula investing. If we would know how to do it well and understand the business we wouldn't need all this. However we can do a simple trick. We make 3 scenarios and we pick growth fcf last year, last 3, last 5, last 10 and last 20. Bear case : Will be the lowest of the previous and if the industry is growing much slower, you could even average both number. Base case :last 20 or 10 year growth or more recent if it went up lastly, maybe 5 year or 3 is good. Never pick 1 year last. Here you can also average with industry cage. For bull case you just pick highest interval without average. For terminal growth you use 5-10%. You determine this with gut feeling, the one that looks more likely. We give a point if we have 10% or more margin respect current price with discount rate of 10%. - 1 if it's lower. Like this for each category. If both normal and bear give that stock is overpriced, we don't buy

2.4 : Qualitative, understand the business : As I said we don't want to spend much time but we can spend some to see this : Founders still in the company if company is young, otherwise give 0 points. Second we want that insiders are buying and insiders have 10% or more of shares. We want margins and eps stable over time, indication of a good moat.

Final considerations :
 After picking a stock and doing all this, if goes well you can buy. You want a porfolio with 15-30 stocks and revisions each quarter to see if each still pass all the metrics, otherwise sell. The qualitative metric is very short and weak so that one can be ignored if all others look good. But this is just my opinion, you need to assess. Also 1 year beta of portfolio must be always between 0.5 and 1.5. This is to ensure you don't have too much volatility but also you have good gains since even conservative formula has an average of 0.7 beta. Anothe is that stocks can't be ever lower than 50M market cap. The upper limit isn't set. Some books recommend less than 1B for retail investors but honestly I have seen amazing opportunities with more. I suggest diversified portfolio between countries, companh sizes and sectors. Also you can use this strategy with 70-80% portfolio and still use the rest for your personal bets like bitcoin, gold, silver, bonds, housing... 


Now why do I tell all this? If you reach this point I only want you tell me your honest opinion of this strategy, tips, recommendations or even suggest books. Thanks ",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mez5mo/a_simple_value_investing_strategy_for_the_retail/

2025-08-01 14:36:56,AMD is evolving from a chip supplier to a full-fledged AI computing platform player,"The MI350 is close enough to Nvidia's performance that AMD can finally charge something closer to a premium price. This chip is no longer just an affordable alternative - it's being used in real-world, mission-critical AI workloads. Most importantly, this is the ‚Äúearly inflection point‚Äù in the changing competitive landscape you've been watching.



Revenue and margin gains are real 

At higher average selling prices, AMD has been able to grow significantly without having to dramatically increase volume. Even the relatively low volume of the MI350 ($25K) is likely to boost Q3 and Q4 results, especially considering that they will be compared to a period when China's exports were hit hard. Margins could also improve: shifting more of the GPU portfolio to higher-end SKUs will help close AMD's earnings gap with Nvidia and Broadcom - which still limits AMD's P/E ratio.



The market expects AMD's GPU revenue to be around $1.65 billion in the third quarter. If MI355X grows as expected in the second half of the year and prices move in line with expectations, AMD's revenue could be revised upward.



Major customers could be behind this move 

AMD wouldn't be pressing prices so aggressively unless major cloud service providers such as Meta ( META ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) were on board. There is growing evidence that these customers are no longer just interested in AMD's GPUs, but are actually actively deploying them. We saw early signs of this in our Q1 earnings call and earnings filings. Customers appear to be buying AMD's complete AI platform, including ROCm, system integration and long-term support.



AMD vs. Nvidia: The Price Gap is Narrowing 

Even at $25K, the MI350 is less expensive than Nvidia's B200, making AMD an attractive choice for workloads such as inference, especially among enterprises and second-tier cloud service providers that can't justify Nvidia's pricing. This creates an optimal balance of ‚Äúvalue and performance,‚Äù and AMD is helping to lead the way in certain market segments. This marks a significant shift in the competitive landscape.



Risks remain, but the narrative is changing 

Headwinds remain. China's export restrictions could result in a revenue reduction of \~$800 million in the second half of 2025, and it is unclear if or when licenses will resume. mi355x needs to be released smoothly and continue the momentum of mi350 - any issues with the software or system will be closely watched. rocm is still lagging behind CUDA in developer adoption. Still lagging behind CUDA in terms of adoption, but improving: ROCm now offers day one support for LLaMA 4 and there are over 2 million models optimized for AMD GPUs on Hugging Face.



Overall 

This indicates a shift in AMD's strategy. It supports our broader view that the company is no longer confined to the role of low-cost alternative, but is moving towards leadership in AI computing. If these pricing trends continue - and especially if they trigger even a modest ‚Äúahead-of-the-curve‚Äù cycle - the market may begin to reassess AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a AMD as less of a traditional chipmaker and more of a platform company. As these fundamentals strengthen, the technological breakthroughs we've seen from AMD, especially relative to NVIDIA, could begin to gain real staying power.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mey6ge/amd_is_evolving_from_a_chip_supplier_to_a/

EZCORP ($EZPW), of all companies, posted a stealthy¬†*double beat*: earnings up 33.6%, revenue up 2.8%. No flashy branding, no AI, no datacenter capital burn. Just... pawnshops.

This is a company built on¬†*short-term credit*¬†and¬†*collateralized lending*. And while everyone‚Äôs been watching Nvidia, this pawn empire (with operations across the U.S. and Latin America) is quietly riding the wave of inflation, tighter credit, and gold appreciation.

**Macro tailwinds: tighter credit environment, inflation and gold price**

The Fed's not cutting rates. Credit card APRs are soaring 25%+. Inflation is likely rising. Subprime borrowers are getting squeezed harder than a lime at a Mezcal tasting. Enter EZCORP. In short: banks are saying ‚Äúno,‚Äù and EZCORP is saying ‚Äúshow me your gold chain.‚Äù

These are¬†**non-recourse loans**. No bank account required, no credit checks. Just cash on the spot. It‚Äôs old-school lending but scaled. EZCORP now runs¬†**1,284 stores**, including Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras.

And here‚Äôs the kicker: the¬†**average U.S. loan**¬†they give out is up to¬†**$207**, from $185 last year, partly because gold prices are climbing. That means more revenue per transaction, backed by assets they can resell

# Q2 FY25: EZCORP‚Äôs quiet blowout

|Metric|Q2 FY25|YoY Growth|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|Revenue|$318.9M|\+12%|
|Pawn Loans Outstanding (PLO)|$271.8M|\+15%|
|EBITDA|$45.1M|\+23%|
|EPS (diluted)|$0.34|\+21%|
|Merchandise Sales|$177.4M|\+8%|
|Gross Profit|$185.0M|\+10%|
|Cash on Balance Sheet|505.2M|Up 3x QoQ|

And yet?¬†**Wall Street barely blinked.**  
Yes - the stock is up 8%, but still it's a very cheap business, if we are considering the valuations...

* EPS (annualized): \~$1.36
* PEG ratio (15% est. growth):¬†**0.73**
* Forward P/E: \~10.5
* Analyst PT:¬†**$21-$22**

* **Implied upside: \~47%**

Assumptions:

* FCF starting point: $107.6M (TTM)¬†*NOTE: Strong YoY growth of*¬†***+232%***¬†¬†*driven by both operational efficiency and the refinancing event in Q2 FY25.*
* Growth: 10% (5 years), Terminal: 3%
* WACC: 9%
* Diluted shares outstanding: 83.1M

‚Üí¬†**Fair Value Estimate: ¬± $20.5/share**

Even under conservative assumptions, this stock trades at a¬†**meaningful discount to intrinsic value**.

# Short interest: quietly squeezable?

* **Short Float:**¬†17.96%
* **Short Interest:**¬†8.89M shares
* **Days to Cover:**¬†9.36
* **Short Shares Available:**¬†Just 1.7M

# Charting the breakout: RSI, Channel, and Volume say Yes

On the¬†**monthly chart**, EZPW has:

* Held a long-term¬†**uptrend channel**¬†since 2020
* Shown¬†**bullish divergence**¬†on RSI
* Seen¬†**increased volume and positive MACD crossover**
* Strong support around $12.50‚Äì13.00
* Key resistance ahead at \~$15.80 and $21.00

The setup is textbook: consistent higher lows, a bullish RSI trendline, and increasing conviction.

**Institutional confidence + smart money quietly accumulating**

While EZCORP doesn‚Äôt make headlines, it does sit in portfolios run by¬†**BlackRock (owns ¬± 15.7%), Vanguard (owns ¬±5.9%), and Dimensional Fund Advisors (¬± owns 6.7)**. Together they hold a substantial interest in the business of ¬±28%. On top, recent repurchases by management (albeit modest) signal quiet confidence, and the company still sits under most radar screens. A value trap for shorts, and a value¬†*play*¬†for those with a spine.

**Scaling the unsexy way: EZCORP‚Äôs inner Costco**

Pawnshops aren‚Äôt new. But scaling a pawn¬†*empire*¬†across Latin America? That‚Äôs innovation via¬†*distribution*. EZCORP has added¬†**44 new stores YoY**, including 9 de novo LatAm locations and 1 acquisition.

What‚Äôs more impressive:

* 6.2M EZ+ Rewards users, up 34%
* 25% growth in online luxury sales via¬†**Max Pawn eBay channel**
* 30% of U.S. stores now offer ‚Äúview online, buy in-store‚Äù
* 15% jump in layaways after launching longer terms

Like¬†**Costco**, EZCORP focuses on¬†**volume, repeat traffic, and margin control**. Just with Rolexes instead of rotisserie chickens.

# Final words: great entry

EZCORP isn‚Äôt riding a hype cycle. It‚Äôs riding the¬†*macro reality*¬†that millions of people are financially squeezed and need fast, dignified access to cash. EZCORP is the kind of business that thrives when the economy doesn‚Äôt. Worth a look.

It‚Äôs a profitable, cash-rich business, growing smartly in emerging markets, sitting on a short interest keg, and trading at a discount. What‚Äôs not to like?

2025-08-01 13:44:09,"EU-US Steel Agreement Stalemate: Tariffs Remain in Place, Quota Negotiations Will Determine the Fate of the Steel Sector","What happened?

The EU and the US have just reached a broad trade agreement imposing a 15% tariff on EU exports (covering automobiles, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and other sectors), avoiding the originally planned 30% punitive tariff.

However, steel and aluminum remain subject to tariffs as high as 50% until both sides reach a final agreement on the ‚Äúquota system,‚Äù and negotiations on this matter are still ongoing.

The EU has temporarily extended the suspension of retaliatory measures (until August) to await the outcome of the negotiations.

The EU steel industry association has warned that if the issue is not resolved, approximately 3.8 million tons of steel exports to the US could be completely blocked, which could severely impact the already oversupplied EU steel market, especially in the face of Chinese capacity dumping.

What does this mean for the stock market?

European steel companies are most affected

Stocks like ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp are under significant pressure: export channels to the US have been almost completely cut off.

They are also facing triple pressure: high energy costs, weak domestic demand, and the impact of low-priced Chinese steel.

This could be positive for US steel companies and industrial stocks

US domestic steel manufacturers will benefit from reduced European competition.

Some US industrial companies reliant on steel components (such as automotive and construction machinery) may be indirectly affected, depending on whether raw material costs rise.

Impact on the overall market

This agreement has somewhat alleviated fears of an escalating trade war, which is generally positive for the overall market.

However, the steel issue remains an ‚Äúunresolved mystery,‚Äù which will drag down the performance of related sectors in the short term and become an invisible factor in market volatility.

Which stocks should be watched?

Investment strategy    Underlying logic

Short EU steel stocks    Export restrictions + excess capacity + high costs, significant fundamental pressure

Long U.S. steel or domestic auto stocks    Benefit from trade protection and potential price increases

Watch industrial stocks    Monitor whether supply chain costs change due to steel price fluctuations

 Final thoughts:

This trade agreement is a ‚Äúdouble-edged sword‚Äù: it alleviates overall tariff concerns, but the steel sector is singled out to continue facing pressure. Before the 50% tariff is lifted, European steel manufacturers may continue to contract, while U.S. manufacturers may benefit from structural advantages.

The key focus moving forward is the ‚Äúquota negotiations‚Äù; once the results are announced, the market will immediately reprice.

Have any of you already invested in steel or materials stocks? How do you view the future market outlook? How should one position ahead of the quota scheme announcement?",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1mewviq/euus_steel_agreement_stalemate_tariffs_remain_in/

They have 80-90% of the clear  aligner market share and posted revenue of 1.01B (est. 1.06B) and EPS of 2.49 (est. 2.57), giving murky guidance suggesting the macro environment is causing people to tighten up and opt out of optional ortho treatments. The opposite happened during Covid and they shot up to $700 per share on huge demand in that market. This is now a 4B annual revenue company with a 9B market cap with 1.1B in free cash and no significant debt, they also announced a 150M-170M budget for ‚Äúrestructuring‚Äù to improve margins which are currently 69% gross (they just make software and mold plastic).

* Trump granted Mexico, the US's largest trading partner, a 90-day reprieve on higher tariffs, saying he would extend the country's current tariff rates to allow for more time for negotiations.

* The US agreed to a trade deal South Korea on Wednesday. The South Korea agreement includes a 15% tariff rate on imports from the country, while the US will not be charged a tariff on its exports, Trump said.

* Trump imposed 50% tariffs on semi-finished copper products starting Aug. 1, but he stopped short of applying the duties to copper scrap and input materials, sending copper (HG=F) futures plunging throughout the week.

* The president signed an order to end the de minimis exemption on low-value imports under $800, thereby applying tariffs from Aug. 29.

* Trump signed another order to impose a total of 50% tariffs on many goods from Brazil. However, it exempts key US imports like orange juice and aircraft parts that benefit Embraer (ERJ).

* The US and EU agreed to a trade deal that imposes 15% tariffs on EU goods. The two sides still need to iron out several key issues.
* The US and China completed a third round of trade talks this week, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that they have ""the makings of a trade deal."" The countries face an Aug. 12 deadline to extend a pause on sky-high tariffs.

-----

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

2025-08-01 00:17:54,"Trump Hikes Tariffs to 15‚Äì40% on 70+ Countries; 35% on Canada, 50% on Copper","No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-hikes-tariffs-on-canada-to-35-announces-new-rates-from-15-to-40-for-dozens-of-countries-000338948.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-hikes-tariffs-on-canada-to-35-announces-new-rates-from-15-to-40-for-dozens-of-countries-000338948.html)

The White House took a step forward with President Trump‚Äôs plan to remake the trade landscape by¬†releasing new details Thursday evening¬†that included a raft of new tariff rates now formally authorized by executive order, which set new levels from 15% to 40% on over 70 countries.

The move represents a giant shakeup in the US's trade order, with outlined rates that range from a 35% tariff on Canada (up from 25%) to rates above 30% on nations from Algeria to Switzerland.

But there's a last minute catch, as these new rates will not go into effect for seven days, instead of a midnight Friday deadline as originally planned ‚Äî according to the text of the order.

""These modifications shall be effective ... on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 7 days after the date of this order,"" reads the¬†now signed order.

India, after initial high hopes for a deal that have bogged down in recent weeks, is set to face a 25% rate but now appears to have another week to negotiate.

Taiwan is another top US trading partner and is set to see a 20% rate.

The White House documentation released Thursday also confirmed some of the parameters of recent deals including 19%-20% rates on a range of Southeast Asian nations and an unchanged 10% rate on the United Kingdom.

Dozens of other nations also saw their tariff rates upped to 15% from 10% ‚Äî in line with deals sketched out in recent days that included that¬†headline 15% tariff rate¬†on Europe, South Korea, and Japan.

But some nations were not included in Tuesday‚Äôs release ‚Äî those omitted included many nations with which the US currently has a trade surplus ‚Äî who therefore are set to see their rates remain at 10%, in a surprise relief for some after comments from Trump in recent days suggested 15% would be his new minimum.

Thursday‚Äôs announcement comes as previously announced¬†50% levies on copper¬†are also set to go into effect at midnight tonight.

The White House also has plans for¬†50% tariffs on Brazil¬†which are set to be in fully in effect in a few days.

Thursday‚Äôs advancement did come after one significant delay, with a¬†90-day pause on new tariffs on Mexico, as the president decided to keep rates there at 25% after a ‚Äúvery successful‚Äù meeting.

The rapid-fire tariff moves also came as small business importers and the US Justice Department¬†clashed Thursday¬†over whether President Trump even has the authority to take these actions. Trump‚Äôs team says the 1977 International Economic Emergency Powers Act authorizes the president to ‚Äúregulate‚Äù international commerce after declaring a national emergency.

It‚Äôs also the latest culmination of Trump‚Äôs intense second term focus on tariffs. He declared ""I am a tariff man""¬†back in 2018¬†but has gone far further in his second term.

The latest calculations from the Yale Budget Lab¬†found that¬†these new duties, before Thursday‚Äôs tweaks, suggested consumers already face an overall effective tariff rate of 18.4%, which is the highest rate since 1933. That figure is sure to rise in the coming days as the new tariff levels are digested.

The duties ‚Äî as Trump himself notes almost every day ‚Äî have also already set multiple new¬†tariff revenues records¬†even at the previous levels centered around a 10% floor for tariffs.

As Trump¬†put it on Thursday¬†‚ÄúTariffs are making America GREAT & RICH Again‚Äù adding that lower levels seen in previous decades were hurting America and ‚Äúnow the tide has completely turned.‚Äù",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1mei0fc/trump_hikes_tariffs_to_1540_on_70_countries_35_on/

How much profit have they made from AI? Close to nothing.

Look at Microsoft. Co-pilot has basically been bolted on to Office. Then Microsoft jacked up the price. But would people actually pay for Co-pilot on its own? Most probably not. So Microsoft can brag this is AI revenue when we know the reality is people are being forced to buy co-pilot to have Office.

Even if we assume people want to pay for co-pilot it‚Äôs revenue is microscopic compared to the amount of money Microsoft is paying for AI. 

We see similar weak AI revenue streams from Google, Facebook and Amazon.

What‚Äôs being missed:

AMD is gaining quiet traction from Nvidia in segments that care about control and efficiency - specifically open-source AI deployments. That preference isn‚Äôt ideological, it‚Äôs architectural.

The core demand is coming from three categories:

	1.	Sovereign buyers (EU, Middle East) who won‚Äôt bet their AI stack on a black-box vendor.

	2.	Hyperscalers (MSFT, META, Oracle) selectively onboarding AMD into their model training workflows to reduce vendor lock-in.

	3.	Startups and smaller firms where unit economics matter, and AMD‚Äôs open-source orientation offers clear flexibility advantages.

The idea that Nvidia has a permanent hardware monopoly is a form of mental laziness. AMD doesn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù Nvidia - it only needs to absorb the non-Nvidia demand that‚Äôs scaling underneath the narrative.

The market is large. The shift is already happening.

2025-07-31 21:42:32,Factoring in inflation when calculating long term rates of return,"If I want to calculate a reasonable rate of return for my investments I tend to be very conservative, but, as im sure many of you also do, i still want to look at roughly how much money i could end up with after 20 or 30 years of being on this investing path.

So when I use a compound interest calculator, I've noticed one thing that i find interesting, and because of my lack of proper math expertise, i wanted to ask you guys and girls about it. Maybe it will clear things up for folks that have had the same doubt. 

If I understand correctly, when i count on a 7% yearly nominal rate of return, and expect a 3% average yearly inflation, this would be equivalent to a 4% real yearly return on my investment. (That's conservative, I'm well aware but it's just an example, the actual numbers are irrelevant)

However this formula doesn't take into account that when i'm Dollar Cost Averaging, the value of my monthly or bi-weekly investments is going to be worth less and less as years go by, so if I invest 500 dollars a month now, by the time 25 years have passed, investing 500 dollars a month will have a much lower real value than today. 

So my question is: 

- Am I wrong? Simply taking nominal returns and adjusting them for inflation seem to forget that the real value of my monthly payments is also continually decreasing. 

- If so, are the compound interest calculators useless? Even when they explicitly ask you for an estimated yearly inflation, they don't seem to take into account the decreasing value of your DCA investments, so they end up greatly overestimating the actual real value of accumulated investments by a lot. 


I find this notion arrogant on my behalf and I assume im making a math mistake, as i doubt institutions like Financial Times or the US Gov wouldn't take this into account in their compound interest calculators. But I've been looking it up and im growingly confused about it. 

I guess that if I was right, the answer would be to continually adjust my monthly payments to match inflation? So 500 dollars on year one, 510 en year 2, etc...   


I hope i made my doubts clear. 
Have a great day.

I would read articles, scroll through Reddit, watch market news and still feel stuck. Either the market felt too high, or too risky, or I was overthinking every stock I looked at.

2025-07-31 16:29:46,"$FIG is indicating $95-100, per CNBC","That values it at \~$59B,  at $100/share, and implies close to $40B overvaluation. The article below has stale numbers but wanted to include for context.

>The indications, which are signals from market makers of the level where trading may begin, imply as much as a 112% gain above the IPO price of $33 apiece. The shares were marketed for $30 to $32 per share, after the company increased the range earlier in the week.

>The company sold 12.47 million shares in the IPO, which priced Tuesday, while investors including Index Ventures, Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins sold 24.46 million shares.

>The IPO pricing gives Figma a market value of $16.1 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. Accounting for employee stock options and restricted stock units, the company has a fully diluted value of roughly $18.5 billion.

>Including restricted stock units for Chief Executive Officer Dylan Field, which are subject to vesting conditions, the fully diluted value would rise above $19 billion.

>The figure is approaching the $20 billion valuation Figma would have fetched in a planned sale to Adobe Inc. that fell apart in 2023.

>The shares offered in Figma‚Äôs IPO were approaching 40 times oversubscribed, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, in a sign of robust demand for the first sizable software offering in the US since SailPoint Inc.‚Äôs debut in February.

>Figma is used to design web and mobile application interfaces. It has expanded its suite of products in an attempt to be more useful for software development and general workplace collaboration.

>Like many software firms, Figma charges clients based on the number of users and the kind of seat those users have. It added Dev Mode to the platform in 2023 to enable closer collaboration with developers, and has more recently incorporated AI technology into many of its own tools. This year it introduced Figma Make, an AI-based product that lets the user turn prompts into functional prototypes.

>Now that the company is public, ‚Äúwe have to continue to sprint, to push hard, and we can‚Äôt let the public markets distract us,‚Äù Field said in an interview.

>Going public allows Figma to have a big brand moment which centers the importance of design, Field said. ‚ÄúThis is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it.‚Äù

>The company is growing quickly, with a 46% year on year increase in first-quarter revenue.

>A key question for Figma‚Äôs long-term success is whether it can become a tool used pervasively used by office workers beyond designers. The company‚Äôs suite of tools is seeing strong adoption by software developers, product managers, and marketers, said Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia Capital and a member of Figma‚Äôs board.

>Sequoia, one of the most storied Silicon Valley venture firms, first invested in Figma in 2019. Around this time, companies were beginning to adopt Figma‚Äôs product en masse, Reed said.

>The use of AI-focused software creation apps which are potential competitors to Figma, such as Lovable and Bolt, has rapidly increased this year. Weaving AI features through Figma is a top priority, Field said. ‚ÄúWe have so much room to explore how we can make great AI products and experiences.‚Äù

>**IPO Volume Climbs**

>The IPO has lifted the volume of first-time share sales on US exchanges above last year‚Äôs pace. There has been more than $21 billion worth of US first-time share sales in the year to date, excluding financial vehicles such as blank-check companies, just behind the $20.2 billion raised in the same period in 2024, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

>Demand for Figma‚Äôs IPO was likely helped by an order-taking process similar to an auction. Prospective investors in Figma‚Äôs offering were asked to precisely state the number of shares they wish to buy and at what price, a person familiar with the matter has said.

>Field will continue to control the company with 74.1% of the votes after the IPO through his holdings of Class B shares that have 15 votes each, the filings show.

>The CEO and fellow Brown University student Evan Wallace started Figma in 2012. Field attended Brown for two and a half years before accepting a Thiel Fellowship, the Peter Thiel-backed program that provides funding to young entrepreneurs, provided they drop out of school. Figma was widely embraced by designers who warmed to its browser-based interface, replacing previous methods of collaboration involving sharing files individually.

>Figma had net income of $44.9 million and revenue of $228 million in the three-month period ended March 31, according to its filings. It reported revenue growth in 2024, though rising operating expenses contributed to a net loss of $732 million for the year.

>Adobe, a maker of software for creative professionals, walked away from the deal to buy Figma following clashes with regulators. It paid a $1 billion termination fee.

>The offering was led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Allen & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The company‚Äôs stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FIG.

2025-07-31 16:09:49,Absolutely everything you need to know about AMZN earnings today,"Okay guys, so Amazon is set to release its Q2 earnings after the market closes today with an analyst call at 5 pm. This is gonna be a big one. Did anyone catch META yesterday? Fuck. 

For Amazon, analysts expect revenue around $162 billion (up 10%) and EPS between $1.32 and $1.33, with operating income projected at $16.7 to $16.87 billion. And during this sesh, the key areas to watch will include AWS growth (estimated at $30.77 billion, up 17%), AI investments (over $100 billion capex planned), and advertising revenue (up 17% to $14.99 billion). Considering the stock performance, it's up 5% year-to-date, with bullish analyst sentiments (e.g., UBS raised price target to $271), but some valuation concerns exist (GF Value at $189.47). External factors like tariffs and Prime Day success could influence outcomes, with potential for significant stock movement based on guidance. I know that people are going to be playing AMZN earnings so I wanted to do a little write up for /r/Stocks so you guys are well informed. And I'll even post what I plan on getting at the end. 

**Analyst Expectations and Financial Projections**

Analysts have provided a range of estimates for Amazon's Q2 performance, showing a lot of optimism. 

Revenue: Expected to be around $162 billion, with variations such as $162.1 billion and $162.19 billion, representing a 9.5% to 10% year-over-year increase.  

Earnings Per Share (EPS): Forecasted at $1.32 to $1.33, up from $1.26 last year, with Amazon having beaten EPS estimates for nine consecutive quarters.  

Operating Income: Projected between $16.7 billion and $16.87 billion, a 13.8% to 15% increase, with an operating margin expected at 10.6% (up from 9.9% last year).  

These projections suggest strong growth, and I honestly think Amazon can exceed these figures and provide robust forward guidance. Especially given its historical ""beat and raise"" pattern, which may not suffice in the current up cycle.

**Key Business Segments and Growth Drivers**

Amazon's diverse operations are expected to drive its Q2 results, with several segments highlighted as critical:  

1) AWS (Amazon Web Services)  

AWS remains a cornerstone of Amazon's profitability, with Q1 2025 revenue up 17% to $29.3 billion. For Q2, net sales are estimated at $30.77 billion, with growth of 17% excluding foreign exchange effects. However, operating margins are expected to drop to 35% due to significant investments in AI and infrastructure, part of a $100+ billion capex plan for 2025. This segment contributed 17% of revenue and 58% of operating income last year, making it a focal point for me.

2) Advertising Revenue  

Advertising is another growth engine, with Q1 2025 revenue up 18%. For Q2, it's projected to rise 17% to $14.99 billion, reflecting increased monetization of Amazon's platform as more businesses leverage its advertising ecosystem.

3) Prime Membership  

Prime membership grew 9% year-over-year to 220 million globally, providing a stable revenue stream through subscription fees. This growth, driven by benefits like free shipping and streaming, is expected to continue supporting Amazon's financials.

4) Operational Efficiency  

Amazon has improved operational efficiency, reducing fulfillment costs and increasing delivery speeds, which should enhance margins. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to balance growth investments with profitability.

5) Investments in AI and Other Areas  

Amazon's commitment to AI is a major theme, with a $100+ billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, primarily focused on AWS and AI services. This includes developing proprietary chips like Trainium2 and partnering with Nvidia to enhance AI capabilities. While these investments may pressure short-term margins, they position Amazon for long-term growth in the expanding AI market. Additionally, Project Kuiper, a satellite initiative, is noted as an area of rising expense, alongside e-commerce and content/advertising investments.

**Analyst sentiments are generally bullish**

UBS raised its price target from $249 to $271, calling Amazon the ""most coiled"" Big Tech name, implying an 18% upside and highlighting extensive investments across e-commerce, AWS, content/advertising, and Kuiper. Other analysts, including Wedbush, William Blair, and Stifel, reiterated ""outperform"" or ""buy"" ratings, with an average price target of $252.66 (range: $195 to $305). 

**External Factors and Market Context**

Several external factors could influence Amazon's earnings and stock reaction:  

Consider the Tariffs. Earlier this year, tariff concerns, particularly on Chinese goods, weighed on the stock, but recovery followed eased U.S. tariffs. Analysts are parsing impacts on e-commerce, with Amazon benefiting from stockpiling ahead of potential tariff hikes.

Also, think about the Prime Day Success. Held in July, Prime Day's performance could lift revenue guidance for the September-ending quarter, providing a positive signal for us.  

And finally, with any earnings post, we need to consider macroeconomic events such as inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending trends could affect retail sales, particularly in online stores and third-party seller revenue, expected to grow 6.5% to $58.99 billion and 7% to $38.74 billion, respectively.

**Potential Catalysts**

I'm expecting accelerating AWS growth, better-than-expected margins, new AI announcements, and strong Q3 guidance. UBS expects upward revisions to operating profit and free-cash-flow as revenue grows, potentially more dramatic than peers.  


**Comparisons**

Microsoft's recent Q2 results, where cloud growth was a significant driver, boosts my confidence in Amazon's cloud business, with MSFT stock jumping 4.47% in after-hours trading. This really does show how important AWS performance will be, as Amazon faces a high bar following Microsoft's strong showing.

**So what to do?**

Amazon's Q2 earnings are poised to be a major event, with strong growth expected across key segments like AWS, advertising, and Prime, supported by significant AI investments. This will be a great opportunity to get a call spread. For those who don't know anything about option trading, you don't need to continue reading. But for those who do, I'll be buying the 8/1 245c (@ 2.67) and selling the 252.5c (@ 1.11). This means I can get the spread for $156, with a potential max gain of 4.8x if AMZN can go up about 7.8% with earnings. Considering the stock moves on average about ¬±8% with earnings, there's a good chance it'll go up 4-8% today. 

Next week tho, we have a ton more earnings so I think I'll be doing a post on PLTR and AMD.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1me5q6m/absolutely_everything_you_need_to_know_about_amzn/

2025-07-31 13:43:32,Nvidia‚Äôs first-mover advantage is real but AMD is now ready to capture a significant share of the AI GPU market,"I think that AMD's release of the MI350 series of GPUs will give them a significant presence in the market for the following main reasons. First of all, the performance metrics I mentioned earlier put it on par with Nvidia in terms of hardware. Considering Nvidia's staggering GPU margins, AMD could offer a similar product at a much lower price to grab market share. In fact, there are reports that AMD has plans to raise prices, which one would guess indicates strong demand for its MI350 series.



While data center expansions may not have been worth it for developers in the past, hundreds of billions of dollars are currently being poured into GPUs for AI. Saving even a fraction of that would incentivize companies and their developers to use AMD's open-source ROCm platform instead of CUDA. in short, the GPU market is much larger than it used to be due to the demand for AI, and that changes the economics. In the past, it may not have been worth a developer's time to add a new server stack, but when building entirely new data centers specifically for AI, it makes sense to figure these things out if you can save even 10%.



Additionally, the AI market needs GPU resources both for training to build models and for inference to apply those models to solve problems in real-world scenarios. In the early days of the AI boom, training required more resources, or at least about half of each. In the future, reasoning resources are expected to grow faster than training resources. Fortunately (or more likely by design), products such as AMD's MI350 excel at inference and are on par with the Blackwell family. Here's how much AMD expects AI usage to continue to grow, with breakthroughs in training and inference",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1me1y8x/nvidias_firstmover_advantage_is_real_but_amd_is/

The bigger problem however is that core PCE has now been around 2.8% since the beginning of 2024 so more than 1,5 years! Does that mean inflation will basically get entrenched at this number, like I don't see what will actually bring it down back to the Fed's target of 2%. If anything, Trump's tariffs at this point haven't added alot to the inflation data as most companies have been stocking up frontrunning the tariffs but at some point companies will at least pass on some tariff cost to the consumers.

2025-07-31 12:50:17,Microsoft Nears $4 Trillion Market Cap After Another Strong Quarter  Reddit Earnings Tonight Could Surprise,"Microsoft just dropped its Q4 earnings and, honestly, it‚Äôs pretty impressive. The company beat on both revenue and earnings again, with Azure cloud revenue hitting $75 billion for the year  up 34%. CEO Satya Nadella said AI and cloud are driving business transformation everywhere, and judging by the numbers, it‚Äôs hard to argue. The stock popped about 9% in pre-market trading, putting Microsoft within striking distance of a $4 trillion market cap. That‚Äôs insane.

Some analysts say FY26 will be the real AI breakout year for Microsoft  meaning this quarter is just the warm-up act. And with tools like Copilot gaining traction, it feels like the company still has plenty of runway. But here‚Äôs the thing: with shares jumping so fast, is now the time to buy more, or are we getting ahead of ourselves?

Meanwhile, Reddit is set to report Q2 earnings after the bell today. The stock has been volatile since its IPO  beating expectations on revenue and earnings but getting hit because daily active user (DAU) growth has slowed, partly due to changes in Google‚Äôs search algorithm that impacted traffic. Google still sends Reddit roughly 40-50% of its traffic, so that‚Äôs a big risk.

That said, some signs suggest Reddit‚Äôs user growth might be stabilizing, and their recent launch of AI-powered ad tools could be a game-changer. If they can show some real DAU growth or ad revenue momentum tonight, the stock might pop again. But how much of Reddit‚Äôs future is tied to Google‚Äôs whims? Is Reddit‚Äôs community strong enough to survive if that traffic tap slows?

Looking at the bigger picture, this AI and cloud run feels a bit like the early days of cloud computing back in 2020  huge opportunity, but also a risk of buying into froth. Are you leaning into giants like Microsoft and Nvidia that have proven track records, or are you more interested in higher-risk, higher-reward names like Reddit? And with Amazon and Apple earnings coming soon, August is shaping up to be an interesting month.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1me0p6y/microsoft_nears_4_trillion_market_cap_after/

While no permanent ruling by the Courts will come today, the arguments and Judge's questions should provide insight into the outcome.

2025-07-16 19:11:28,Annual PSA: Investing and Trading Scam Reminder,"For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - please be aware that social media platform like Reddit, Discord, etc. can be a vector for scams and fraud. 

Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. 

Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to pig-buthering scams and pump-and-dump scams. - do not assume that an offer to ""help"" is legitimate.

1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot](https://dfpi.ca.gov/news/insights/pig-butchering-how-to-spot-and-report-the-scam/)
2. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else.
3. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks.
4. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion.
5. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary.

If you are in the US - you can always verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. You can check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here -¬†[https://brokercheck.finra.org/](https://brokercheck.finra.org/)¬†You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here -¬†[https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/](https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/)

For those interested in understanding a little more about stock promoting and pump-and-dumps - one of the mods provided an AMA 15 years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with - you can find the AMA here -¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/158vi7/i\_used\_to\_be\_a\_penny\_stock\_promoter\_in\_the\_late/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/158vi7/i_used_to_be_a_penny_stock_promoter_in_the_late/)",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1m1llzv/annual_psa_investing_and_trading_scam_reminder/
