This is still a company growing at more than 100% per year at 40x forward earnings. The Trump administration will continue to deregulate across the board, so I don’t believe their core business model is at risk for at least the next 3 years. Macro liquidity is going higher along with HIMS continuing to be a retail favorite. This is an opportunity to buy a market leader at a significant discount. Could it go lower? Absolutely, but in my mind the likelihood of this stock making significant new highs this year is quite good.

he’s not going to give anyone a july cut nod because that locks him in. the fed doesn’t do promises anymore. he’ll point to the last cpi print and say yeah, progress, but not enough. then he’ll throw in some language about risks being more balanced, which is his way of saying we’re not hiking but we’re also not cutting until mango launches nukes.

expect him to get grilled on politics. he’ll give the usual fed independence line: he’s not taking orders from the white house. he’s not playing ball with reelect agendas. he’ll keep it boring. NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN

prior authorization has been a massive headache for providers and patients, blamed for delays in care and tons of admin bloat.

No real details on how this will happen but the optics are clear: regulators are applying pressure and insurers are trying to show good faith.

So far market reaction is muted UNH CVS HUM all flat to down.

But CI Cigna actually held up  +0.68% while the rest were red.

CI has been flying under the radar lately no meme hype no flashy headlines  just grinding higher.

If they’re seen as more compliant flexible than UNH CVS they could quietly benefit from policy tailwinds.

**Positions:** I am sitting on 90% cash and using my 10% for day trading - Recent profits were all on INTC and TSLA. I always close EOD. I bought FSENX for 5% of my funds

**Thought:** I like looking at indirect impact points in addition to traditional technicals. Example - I keep an eye on are on Fedex/UPS earnings calls for retail forecasts (shipping volume directly proportional to sales numbers), banking earnings for understanding liquidity, credit availability, and investment returns etc. and not wait for formal readings like CPI etc to post.

**Target:** I have a SPY target of 550 to 600 for July 2026.

**Discussion points:**

* **Inflation** has not hit the economy yet, but this weeks earnings will start showing hints of it.
* Inflation if not controlled can impact **liquidity** (can impact 401k contributions, DCA contributions etc...)
* **War is never cheap** and thought it can give short term bursts of boosts to stock markets with rumors.
* **Debt** is good until it is within means - i.e. Debt < GDP
* **Risk fatigue is real** \- Your month on month contributions are being blindly invested in those target funds without risk readings taken into considerations and rug pulls are not uncommon.
* **AI bubble** is similar to the dot com bubble - those who know it, know it that dot com investments went beyond the realistic capabilities that were not realized until 10-15 years down the line but by then the bubble burst and took 10-12 years to recover.

Am I wrong to conclude here why bother with the mutual funds since the bonds have such a good return?",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lije3b/etfs_vs_usa_government_bonds/

2025-06-23 14:29:48,401k Withdrawal for CC debt,"UPDATE:  Thanks to everyone for straightening me out.  I have decided to just stop putting deposits into my 401k and use the extra money each month to pay off the CC debt.  It will only take me a year and a half to resolve the CC debt and then I can really ramp up the deposits into my 401k.  Thanks so much everyone!!  

I want to clear up my remaining CC debt without having to pay several years on high interest.  I'd much rather take out from my 401k to clear it up and then I can invest more back into my 401k and I can catch up in 1 year and thus be able to continue to pump more into my 401k for the years to come.  I went to the online site and I don't see any options in the Hardship section that fits my category.  Do I select other and just type in what I plan to do with the money?

2025-06-23 13:47:17,Opportunities in the short-term market volatility? I'm sharing a low-risk offensive strategy that I've been tracking recently,"Over the past few weeks, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have been fluctuating repeatedly at high levels. Many friends have said, ""The direction is unclear and we dare not act."" But in fact, the oscillation range is precisely when the low-risk strategy comes into play.

Recently, I have been tracking a simplified version of a strategy that combines range-bound oscillation and breakout following. The core logic is:

After determining the key support/resistance areas in major indices (such as $SPY / $QQQ) or large-cap stocks (such as $AAPL / $NVDA), observe the changes in trading volume and K-line structure.

Place an observation order near the upper edge of the range. Once the volume increases and breaks through, follow to open small positions. If there is a false breakout, the stop-loss is extremely small (usually less than 1%).

Auxiliary indicators use simple moving averages (such as EMA20, EMA50) + RSI divergence to determine whether the breakout is healthy.

Last week, I followed up with a small position using this framework when $NVDA broke through 1100, with a profit target in the 1150 range. The stop-loss is set below 1085, and the risk is very controllable.

I wouldn't say this is a ""sure-win strategy"", but its advantage lies in:

The risk is low, the cost of making mistakes is low, and it does not rely on prediction but only on market signals. It is suitable for volatile markets and the initial trend formation stage

[**HIMS (Hims & Hers Health)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HIMS&p=d)\-NVO announced it would terminate its collaboration with the telehealth company over the sale of weight-loss drug Wegovy, accusing HIMS of ""disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk."" Interested in seeing where this goes at the open, it's moved a significant amount already. We were at highs on this news last month, and we're down 20%- interested to see if we break $50 at the open. Telehealth is very dependent on partnerships with big pharma. NVO has also moved down on this news, and OSCR, which has been heavily momentum based for the past 2 days has moved down as well.

[**CRCL (Circle Internet Financial)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\-Making new highs, topped out around $266 premarket. This is primarily momentum based so interested in the turn, I want to see what this does at the open before entering any position, short biased. This has primarily been moving due to the U.S. Senate passing the GENIUS Act (StableC Bill). It now heads to House before Trump’s desk, with the White House targeting approval by August. If the bill fails, this will turn back significantly and will be a killer reversal.

[**USO (United States Oil Fund)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d)\-Following U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites over the weekend, USO spiked overnight; awaiting Iran’s response. We haven't seen any spike that's TOO crazy yet, Iran has options to retaliate and cause the price of oil to spike so this is more of a catalyst to be aware of rather than something that will occur today.

2025-06-23 12:35:24,Archer Aviation linking up with FAA and global regulators  feels like a pretty big step,"Just read a piece about ACHR from the Paris Air Show, apparently they’re now working with the FAA, DOT & regulators in the UK, Canada, Australia & NZ to create a unified certification process for eVTOLs

CEO Adam Goldstein said it’s *“a step toward bringing our Midnight aircraft to skies around the world,”* which honestly sounds like more progress than I expected at this stage

It’s not just the FAA now, they’re trying to line things up globally, which could be a huge advantage if they’re first

They’ve also got their first Midnight deliveries scheduled for this summer in the UAE ***(Abu Dhabi Aviation + Ethiopian Airlines),*** and just announced a new software partnership with Palantir to build out aviation systems. So it looks like they’re stacking the pieces: hardware, software, and regulatory.

Financials are still rough, last quarter they reported a $93M net loss, but they’ve got over $1B in cash and just raised another $850M. So runway isn’t the issue right now. The bigger question is how fast they can move from testing to actual paid operations.

Still zero revenue, obviously, but the article points out they’re leading the sector and up over 220% in the last year. Volatile, but seems like they’re ahead of the other players in terms of actual execution.

Not saying I’m all in, but this feels different from the typical “flying car” hype. Curious if anyone here is holding or watching it too.

>The Danish drugmaker said Monday it would no longer provide Hims & Hers with direct access to its FDA-approved weight loss drug Wegovy through NovoCare Pharmacy. The partnership, which was expanded just last month in April, had aimed to make obesity treatments more accessible and affordable for Americans.

>According to Novo Nordisk, the decision comes after Hims & Hers allegedly failed to comply with laws prohibiting mass sales of compounded drugs. The pharmaceutical company accused the telehealth provider of ""disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk.""

>""Novo Nordisk is firm on our position and protecting patients living with obesity,"" said Dave Moore, Executive Vice President of US Operations at Novo Nordisk. ""When patients are prescribed semaglutide treatments by their licensed healthcare professional or a telehealth provider, they are entitled to receive authentic, FDA-approved and regulated Wegovy.""

>The original collaboration, announced in April, had offered Americans access to Wegovy through the Hims & Hers platform at a unified price starting at $599 per month, which included the medication along with 24/7 care, clinical support, and nutrition guidance.

>Novo Nordisk expressed concerns about ""knock-off drugs"" made with foreign ingredients, specifically citing suppliers from China that have not been authorized by the FDA to manufacture semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy.

I'm 30F from the Philippines. I came to Taiwan carrying nothing but emotional pain from growing up with an absent father. I have four younger siblings who are still enduring the same emotional struggles back home, and I really wanted to save them.

I arrived in Taiwan with 0 nada in my pocket. But after two years of studying and working part-time jobs, I managed to save USD 4,000. It might not seem like much, but to me, it's the beginning of something bigger.

Now, I'm determined to use this money wisely. My goal is to prove to myself and my father that I can rise from nothing, and build a future that’s not only stable, but abundant. I want to be rich and give my siblings the financial security they never had. 

I apologize if I shared a bit too much information.  But, I was hoping I could find a mentor or financial advisor who might be willing to guide me likd where to start and how to make the most of what I have, and so on. I figured it’s only proper to share a bit of my background and motivations. Hehe thank you so much. 🥹🥹🥹

\- Demand rebounding (auto production recovering, hybrids need palladium)  
\- No easy substitute (platinum still not a full replacement)

Here's the kicker, Thinking Machine Labs has no product. All it has is a vague stated goal ""to make AI systems more widely understood, customizable, and generally capable"" and a bunch of AI heavy hitters on its founding team. 

It's also a public benefit corporation. So, you know, a ton of money to ""make the world a better place"" with the corporate equivalent of ""a concept of a plan"". Nothing to see here, folks. 

To top it off, the company is structured in such a way Murati's votes on the BOD are weighted to give her majority decision making capability. What could possibly go wrong?

For the period ending May 29, Micron said it earned an adjusted $1.91 per share as revenue surged 36.6% year-over-year to come in at $9.3B. A consensus of analysts expected the company to earn $1.61 per share on $8.85B in revenue.

Adjusted gross margins during the period were 37.7%, while adjusted free cash flow was $1.95B.

""Micron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in HBM revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled year-over-year and reached a quarterly record, and consumer-oriented end markets had strong sequential growth,"" said Sanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President and CEO of Micron Technology. ""We are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we make disciplined investments to build on our technology leadership and manufacturing excellence to satisfy growing AI-driven memory demand.""

Looking ahead, Micron said it expects adjusted earnings to be between $2.35 and $2.65 per share, with the midpoint of $2.50 well above the $2.05 per share estimate. Sales are forecast to be between $10.4B and $11B, with the midpoint of $10.7B well above the $9.9B estimate.

The company will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. EST to discuss the results.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lkgb09/micron_shares_rocket_higher_as_q3_results_as_well/

3. AI ops stack & tools: production-scale LLM monitoring, orchestration, and observability are becoming critical infrastructure for every enterprise deploying generative models.
4. Power & cooling bottlenecks: liquid-immersion cooling, advanced switch-gear, and grid-interconnect suppliers are leveraged plays on the thermal and energy constraints now capping AI datacenter build-outs.
5.

2025-06-25 16:44:13,DeepMind Just Launched AlphaGenome A Big Step For DNABased AI And Genomics,"I don't know how many people have noticed this but Google DeepMind has just released a new tool called AlphaGenome which aims to model how genetic variation affects the biological processes that regulate gene expression.

This is the same team behind AlphaFold and AlphaMissense Unusually instead of limiting itself to the 2 per cent of the genome that codes for proteins the focus of most older models AlphaGenome seeks to account for the remaining 98 per cent known as non-coding regions These regions control the on off switching of genes and are linked to a range of diseaseassociated mutations.

It can analyse up to a million DNA base pairs and predict thousands of regulatory features. Apparently it has already outperformed existing tools in 22 out of 24 benchmark tests and passed 24 out of 26 tests related to identifying disease-associated mutations. That impressive.

This model is a milestone  Caleb Lareau MSKCC 

It brings a foundational level of accuracy long-range context and versatility in a unified model.

Currently it is only available as an Application Programming Interface API and is non-commercial but if this technology is validated and deployed into biotechpharma R&D workflows it could dramatically accelerate rare disease research gene therapy and even cancer diagnostics.

No investment thesis here yet but worth tracking for anyone long on GOOGL This is the kind of moonshot stuff that could pay off 3–5 years down the road, especially as AI moves deeper into biohealth.

Google DeepMind released AlphaGenome  an AI model for analyzing DNA regulationOutperforms other tools in most benchmarksCould help identify disease mutations in the 98% of the genome we barely understandStill early but a solid long-term signal for anyone tracking AI x biotechGOOGL up \~2.4% today, possibly partially on this

Trump suggests that if NATO countries like Spain don't pay more, the US could raise tariffs or trade barriers against them Trump suggests that if NATO countries like Spain don't cough up more money  the U.S  could raise tariffs or trade barriers against them.

If you remember the 2018-2019 trade war  it's not a new thing, but now that it's back in the air  it could spark a new round of concerns about U.S.-European trade friction

Considering that Europe's economic growth is weak right now, and that inflation hasn't come down all the way, they're a lot more afraid of this than the U.S.

Market reaction: 

S&P 500: up 0.2% today, basically not taken seriously 

European Stoxx 50: down about 0.6%, suggesting that European investors are already wary 

US military stocks (e.g. RTX, LMT, NOC): up slightly in pre-market, probably gaming expectations of a possible increase in Europe's military spending 

EURUSD: weakened a bit reflecting a decline in confidence in the eurozone

What are the implications for investors

Benefit: 

military industrial companies Europe if really obedient to increase military spending U.S. defense companies are likely to eat.

U.S.-based industrial stocks If trade barriers rise Manufacturing repatriation concepts to be speculated again (focus on CAT, DE, CMI) 

Risk averse assets If geopolitical tensions escalate Gold and U.S. bonds may attract safe-haven funds

Damage: 

European exporters to the U.S. (e.g., BMW, Volkswagen) may face higher tariffs 

U.S. companies with large operations in Europe (e.g., Starbucks, Apple, Nike) may be pressured by policy uncertainty

My take: 

Markets are largely ignoring this at the moment, but if Trump continues to poll higher or European dignitaries publicly respond in a strong way, we can't rule out it becoming a macro risk event 

If that happens, don't be surprised to see volatility spike and Q3 have another tariff scare 

I'm not in a hurry to move my positions, but I've already added LMT and RTX to my watch list, and if this continues to build, the military sector could move first.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lkamnh/trump_threatens_nato_allies_with_higher_military/

Across ten major risk events the name averaged a two day gain of 4.2 percent while the S&P lost 1.3 percent.

The cash stack exceeds two billion and share count growth has slowed to under three percent annually which tamps dilution risk. If free cash flow margin holds north of forty percent a measured buyback could further dampen volatility.

My understanding is….if you buy A stock on June first. Then you sell with $40. You can claim your $60 loss end of you. If you buy back with 31 days. You are not able to claim. 

However, I don’t know how to apply to a in-and-out scenario. 

Scenario 1:
Buy C stock on July 1 @$1000 total, sold on July 20 @$300. End of year, Dec 31, can I claim $700 as my loss? 
When I can rebuy the stock? Can I rebuy the stock on Aug 22? (More than 31 day I can buy the stock?) 

Scenario 2: 
I have 40 transactions of D stocks, each time I earn $100 thru Aug 1-Aug20. Total will be $4000 (40 transactions x$100). 
Until the 41th time on Aug 25, I lost $3800. So, my actual gain is $200 only.  At this point, my tax will be based on $200? 

Scenario 3 
Continue with Scenario 2. However, If I keep trading, I bought D Stocks back on Aug 26. At the 42th trade, I lost $150. My actual gain will be $4000-3800-150=$50 I guess wash sale trigger, since I bought back within 31 days. If I’m correct…wash sale trigger, I can’t write off $3800 and $150 loss. My tax will be based on $4000? Instead of $50. 

Scenario 4:
Continue with the scenario 2. (Win $4000,loss $3800). I bought back. If my 42th trade, I win $300 on Aug 28
That means $4000-3800+300=$500
Will my tax based on $4000 or $500? Wash sale trigger? 

Scenario 5
Continue with Scenario 2 (Win $4000, loss$3800) Then I buy back with 31 days 10 times. I earn 10k in total. At this point, I think I trigger wash sale. I can’t write off $3800. However, it’s doesn’t matter, since I am winning $10k. I don’t mind to pay tax. My tax will be based on $14k? (My actual earnings is $40000-3800+10k, I still pocket 10,200-the tax on 14k)

India is a huge country. It doubles U.S. user counts on both YouTube and Facebook. Yet India is less than one-third the size of US users on Reddit. The upside here is thus enormous.

The model I created on May 13 assumed France-style adoption rates (the yellow projection line). The latest Semrush data shows India blowing through that benchmark (the white dotted projection line).

2025-06-25 15:05:28,What are the perils of a Reverse stock split,"Okay, so I know penney stocks are pretty much a fools errand. That being said, when I was trying to research a concept I was interested in, the only publicly traded company I could find happened to be on the chopping block on the Nasdaq due to trading below 1.00USD.  

So the question. Does anyone know of a stock that flushed after a reverse split? 

My presumption it that the company does the split to raise the stock price to avoid being delisted then issues new stock at the higher stock price to gain additional funding without the need for loans. The company is pretty old so I don't think that this is some fly by night hoodwink. Just curious as to the community's thoughts. Thanks in advance

So Archer is sitting at around $10 right now. According to a recent Pitchstack writeup, they’ve got $2 billion in liquidity after their latest $850M raise. That supposedly gives them enough runway to get through FAA certification and launch commercial services  which is kind of a big deal for a pre revenue company

Their partnerships aren’t fluff either: United Airlines, Delta, Stellantis. Those aren’t speculative letters of intent it’s real validation and access to regulatory + infrastructure support that most eVTOL startups would kill for

Then there’s the macro setup. The government is actively backing advanced air mobility with executive orders. The regulatory environment is shifting in their favor, and Archer is one of the only players positioned to take advantage of it early. They're calling this a “first mover advantage” in a market that could scale massively by the 2030s

Yeah, it's risky. They’re still burning cash around $450M this year and they haven’t commercialized Midnight yet. But the Abu Dhabi vertiport is being built, pilots are being trained, and the path to actual paid flights is clearer than ever.

The article points out that this stock is still not on many hedge fund radars *(only 33 funds held it last quarter),* which tells me the upside hasn’t been fully priced in yet.

I get that it could go sideways for a while. But if they actually pull off commercial ops, this isn’t a meme, it’s a legit mobility shift.

2025-06-25 13:20:00,Has anyone back tested a strategy of tracking towards goal yearly with any surplus gains going into a steady investment?,"Ik there are back testing tools but not really good with them yet and can’t get to exactly this. Never heard of this so guessing results are not very good but curious what this would look like. 

The parameters are basically this:

You are 30 with a goal of retiring by 67 with a goal of hitting $1M in todays $. You calculate $7000 per year (max IRA, goes up roughly with inflation so easy to track) with 6.5% real return gets you to that goal.

The problem is while 6.5% is pretty average year to year, decade to decade, returns swing pretty wildly and the timing of these swings greatly impact performance even if the return is 6.5% over this time. For example really strong early performance when you don’t have much in with much worse performance later when you have a lot in could in total have 6.5% returns but you’d fall short. 

To manage this the portfolio is reallocated at end of every year to smooth this out and increase certainty the goal is hit. 

For example in year 1 there was 2% inflation. With the target of 6.5% real return the goal should be to have $7k grow to $7,595 plus max ira contribution that hopefully tracked roughly with inflation. The market nominally returned 15% though and portfolio stands at $8050. You are $455 above target. In this scenario you move $455 to safe investment that tracks inflation. 

Continue this over and over. Your portfolio in stocks is on target to hit your goal while having surplus in cash. Whenever downswing hits that takes you under target you move cash to equity til it brings you back to target. Anytime you are short of target with no cash you stay 100% equity.

This is still extremely run up (to me). Note that it is mainly run up due to the hype from the senate bill (GENIUS Act). Overall trying to see if we get even close to breaking $200 today. Cbase and HOOD have moved as well (upwards). Typically has a somewhat wide spread (ranges from .50 to $1) so I'm mainly trying to churn as little in this as possible. 

[**NVO (Novo Nordisk)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVO&p=d)\-Still somewhat selling off due to news from their discontinuation of their discontinuation with HIMS, citing illegal practices.

2025-06-25 13:03:59,How to find peace with my investment?,"I've always been frustrated with active investing. I've beaten myself up for not making best decisions and it got me very depressed and irritated even though I am kinda profitable. I feel like I have never done enough research about the companies. I am constantly anxious about my portfolio. Which stocks should I hold? How should I manage the position? Therefore, I tried to study on various technical analysis trading strategies and try a lot of algo trading strategies so that I can have a fully mechanic system to make decision. Then I found that it is very difficult to beat s&p 500. Even if I can do it I think it's not worth the effort because the excess return is not that much and I can not guarantee that the system will consistently outperform the market so it's still walking on thin ice and still kind of discrteional because I need to make decisions on adjusting the strategy.

So two year ago I decided that I should just buy and hold the stock market index and get rid of all the stress. But I was not satisfied with 8\~10% return and thought that I could leverage my exposure and made use of this opportunity after a bear market in 2022. It worked great until this april. I grew my account from 80k to 800k in two years (included my salary income). My basic strategy is to hold 3\~4x leverage broad market future and will add more if there is a bit of correction (like 2023/12 and 2024/8). I planned to stop at 2M net worth so with 4x leverage it's another (2M/800k-1)/4\*100%=37.5% and I'll be set. This april I blew up my account because I added on the way down and ended up overleveraged and got margin called. I went from 800k to less than 50k and realized that it's not really a sustainable strategy. Well, deep down I knew it's not sustainable but I wanted to make use of this post-2022 bull market cycle to the fullest because I hate investing so much that I want to make money faster and then sit with 5\~8% return for the rest of my life.

After this incident, I return to steady investment and am considering go back to active investing and trading. Currently I just hold SPY, QQQ, and NVDA. But I find that I beat myself up for taking profits too early or not buying more or not buying any other rallying stock like AVGO, AMD, and a ton of others. I get really mad to the point it affects every aspect of my life. Sometimes I think to myself is it really worth it if investing makes me financially successful but ruin my overall life. I am looking for any suggestion. Much appreciated.

PS. I want to clarify that I am not sharing my story to just rant about my tramatized experience but to explain my thought process and show that I've tried many approaches in investing and that I've always tried very very hard to outperform the market. So I think I need more advice on mindset and psychology rather than ""find a strategy"" or ""just buy and hold spy"" kind of stuff. I am still open to this advice but I need more psychological aspect of it.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1lk54co/how_to_find_peace_with_my_investment/
2025-06-25 12:40:36,OpenAI’s Self-Driving Ambitions (with TSLA and GOOG),">The artificial intelligence company has set many challenging goals. Autonomous vehicle software is now among them - but may pit the company against Tesla.

>

>Sam Altman has made many big claims about what OpenAI will be able to do, including spearheading ultra-expansive data centers and building artificial intelligence that can rival the abilities of Ph.D. holders.

>But he also recently made a significant, yet largely overlooked, assertion. OpenAI is seeking to crack the code for advanced autonomous driving.

>“We have some new technology that could just do self-driving for standard cars way better than any current approach has worked,” Altman said last week on the “Uncapped With Jack Altman” podcast, which his brother hosts. Altman added, “If our A.I. techniques can really go drive a car, that’s pretty cool.”

>The technology is in its early stages - DealBook hears that it involves both OpenAI’s Sora video software and its robotics team - but commercializing it is still a distant goal. An OpenAI spokesman declined to comment.

>That could make Altman even more of a competitor to Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but has since waged war on the company. (A short reminder: Musk has sued to try to stop OpenAI from revamping its corporate structure, and he’s building a direct competitor, xAI, that’s raising - and spending - billions of dollars.)

>Autonomous vehicles are key to Musk’s vision for Tesla, which he increasingly sees as the producer of huge fleets of fully self-driving cars. Tesla is focusing on A.I.-powered vision rather than on the array of sensors like lidar that Waymo, a Google spinoff, uses.

>One big question mark for OpenAI: Where will its systems get their data? Tesla and Waymo have already amassed huge amounts of information and video through their years of driving on the roads.

>That raises the question of whether OpenAI believes in a fundamentally different approach to self-driving tech, one that relies less on real-world data and more on advanced simulation, synthetic data or a breakthrough in “generalizable” A.I. Of note: The company recently collaborated with Applied Intuition, a start-up focused on putting A.I. in cars.

>(OpenAI’s venture arm also invested in Ghost Autonomy, a self-driving start-up, though the business folded last year.)

>“I think he really gets it,” Altman said of President Trump’s approach to A.I. (Altman has forged close ties to the president, including by donating to his inauguration fund and announcing the Stargate data center project at the White House.) “I think he really understands the importance of leadership in this technology.”

>Altman was uncertain about whether the right A.I. regulations would come to pass: “I have become a bit more, jaded isn’t the right word, but it’s something in that direction, about the ability of policymakers to grapple with the speed of technology.”

>Altman played down reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft as they rework their relationship: “Do you believe that, when you read those things?”

2025-06-25 11:14:19,Why Qualcomm’s Latest Price Target Can’t Be Ignored,"As we head into the final week of June, **Qualcomm** continues to test investors’ patience. Even with a fundamentally solid earnings report in April and a tidy 25% gains since then, the tech giant is failing to ignite the kind of sustained uptrend seen in bigger peers like **NVIDIA** or **Broadcom**. Shares have been drifting downwards for nearly two weeks, though Monday’s 1% gain showed some welcome strength. The uptrend that began in April is technically still intact, but only just.

This lack of momentum has been especially frustrating given Qualcomm’s healthy diversification across handsets, automotive, and the Internet of Things (IoT), not to mention its recent M&A activity.

And yet, analyst coverage has been sparse in comparison to other major chipmakers. That’s why last week’s update from Bank of America can’t be ignored.

# Bank of America Sees at Least 30% Upside

Bank of America’s research team, led by Tal Liani,reiterated its Buy rating on Qualcomm, though it trimmed its price target from $245 to $200. It’s a noteworthy move, while they’ve tempered expectations, they still see roughly 30% upside from where the stock closed on Monday.

Their reasoning was clear. As we mentioned above, Qualcomm’s Q2 earnings were solid, with the numbers coming in ahead of analyst expectations pretty much across the board. Its QCT segment, which includes the company’s core chip business, and its Handsets did especially well, while Automotive and IOT were both impressive too.

# Potential Headwinds for Qualcomm

The problem, though, according to Bank of America, is that some of its sales trends are showing signs of stagnation. As **Apple** , one of Qualcomm’s key customers, continues to bring more and more of its manufacturing in-house, Bank of America now expects its contribution to headset sales to fall sharply and potentially disappear altogether. That’s a huge headwind for a company still heavily dependent on smartphone cycles.

Still, they believe Qualcomm’s AI PCs and data center growth can offset some of the drag, though the company is lacking any near-term catalysts that could spark renewed bullishness. All that being said, however, their updated $200 target reflects a 15x multiple on their 2026 earnings estimate, which keeps Qualcomm looking extremely cheap relative to the sector. The stock’s current forward P/E sits below 14, in stark contrast to NVIDIA’s 46.

These risks aren’t new, but taken together, they help explain why the stock has struggled to build lasting momentum. The Bank of America team could easily have downgraded the stock to a Hold, but they didn’t, and investors should take confidence from that.

And with the stock trading at a highly unusual discount to its peers from a valuation standpoint, you can’t help but feel there’s a bargain to be had here - you might just have to wait a little longer than is ideal for the payoff.

# Watch the Chart

From a technical standpoint, Qualcomm is approaching an inflection point. Last week’s update would have helped spur some bullish interest, but the stock has been effectively trending down for the past fortnight. Crucially, the MACD just completed a bearish crossover, and momentum could turn negative if shares don’t start rallying north soon.

Given the S&P 500 index is on the verge of an all-time record close, bulls will want to see Qualcomm move back towards $160 this week, which would mean it avoids setting a lower low and risking a breakdown of the uptrend.

As AI and edge computing continue to drive long-term demand, stocks like QCOM, AVGO, MAAS, MSFT, MU, and TXN could benefit from renewed infrastructure and device-side innovation, especially in areas like IoT and automotive connectivity.

For investors willing to stomach some near-term volatility, Qualcomm offers an intriguing mix of value, optionality, and a long-term AI tailwind. The latest analyst commentary should serve as a reminder that while the potential mightn’t be as bright as some others out there, it’s far from lost. But unless shares can shake off the lethargy and recapture momentum soon, it may take another upside surprise to get the stock firing again.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lk2wb3/why_qualcomms_latest_price_target_cant_be_ignored/

My portfolio is a bit messy in that it's spread across 2 accounts and in 3 different currencies (USD, GBP, HKD). One of the accounts hold HKD individual stocks, and the other holds GBP and USD based Index funds.

I'm thinking of closing all non-USD positions and bring it all into one account, streamlining everything into USD based index funds.

Doing so will realize some losses as my HKD and GBP positions are currently in the red. And of course, the switch will incur platform and fx fees, but not taxes as there is no capital gains taxes levied where I live.

I'm also wondering if exchanging GBP into USD currently is a good call. My home currency is HKD, it's pegged to USD so I'm not worried about that for the future. I'm using IBKR for the conversion and the switch.

For example, let's say your biggest issue is climate change. If you invest, let's say, $1K in Exxon Mobil, the benefit to Exxon is essentially *nil*\---you are buying the stock from another person, not the company; the only real impact is a totally negligible increase to the share price (I guess... And I guess of like a theoretical 0.00000000000000000000001%?). A few years later, you sell your investment, which is now worth $1.5K. With the $500 profit, you can donate to a green energy non-profit, use the money to help buy solar panels, etc..---direct forms of support which almost certainly have a much greater positive effect than the buying of the stock had a negative effect. So essentially you are buying a stock from someone (who is probably pro-fossil fuels, and whose consumption patterns would probably align to that---i.e., would use the money they make to make the problem even worse) and now having it be owned by yourself, who will take the increased valuation of this company over time and use it *against them* at a much higher impact multiplier.

2025-06-22 22:28:25,Investing a substantial forgivable loan - liquidity and tax considerations,"Burner account because obviously.

I have been offered a substantial forgivable loan from a company, and I'm debating how I would invest the proceeds. The loan is $500,000 total, and I would receive that amount at the inception of the loan. 1/5 of the loan would be forgiven each year for the next five years, assuming I'm still employed at the company. The loan has an interest rate that is equal to the lowest interest rate permitted by the IRS for an 5-year term arm's length loan (currently about 4%), and the accrued interest to date would be forgiven each year in the same manner as the corresponding principal amount as described above. Every time a tranche of the loan is forgiven, I have to pay taxes on the forgiven amount at that time, which is taxed as ordinary income.

.

The substantial risk here is that if I leave the company (or am laid off) during the term of the loan, I have to pay back the non-forgiven principal and interest accrued to date within 30 days. So I need to be pretty liquid with the investment. The goal is therefore to meet or beat the 4% interest rate (ideally, post-tax) but maintain at least pretty good liquidity.

.

In the immediate term, my candidate solution is to invest in individual municipal bonds with a maturity date right before the first tranche of the loan is forgiven (in about a year). Current rates on such municipal bonds I'm seeing are roughly 5%, and they are not subject to federal income taxes, which is a substantial perk. When those bonds mature, I would reassess and probably lean towards reinvesting the proceeds in municipal bonds again with about a one year term.

.

There is liquidity risk in that I could be compelled to repay the loan before those municipal bonds mature, but there are three considerations that mitigate this:

(1) I think it's very unlikely I would separate or be separated from the company within the next six months. Probably if I am separated from the company, the most likely time would be as we approach the date of the first tranche being forgiven.

(2) Municipal bonds can be sold on the secondary market, so I could liquidate early if necessary. Granted, if interest rates go up (and that seems likely!), I might have to sell at a loss, but the volatility here is less than the stock market.

(3) I have the capacity to liquidate other stock investments and/or take out short-term loans (e.g. until the bonds mature) to repay the loan if necessary.

.

So, thoughts? Can you come up with a better solution? It's an interesting problem and not one that I've been able to find much about online. Thank you!",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1li0iw9/investing_a_substantial_forgivable_loan_liquidity/

Welcome to the beginning of my controversial investing journey where I use lifecycle investing to incorporate leverage in my Roth IRA. Currently, I am 27 years old, with $15,000 in my Roth IRA. I’ve bought one LEAP on VTI at a 150 strike when VTI traded at 300 which is essentially 2x exposure at half the cost of the underlying. Yes I understand that the timing of this is less than ideal. I’m currently hedging against the market in my trading account but for the purposes of lifecycle investing, timing doesn’t matter. It’s more so about your time in the market. When it comes to this, I want as little of my opinion as possible. I hesitated to do this for a long time because I know that once I start, I can never stop. The worse case scenario would be starting now and going back to the traditional buy and hold strategy after I lose all my money from a market crash.

Performance:

Initial investment (June 2025): $15,611.64

Current investment (June 2025): $15,611.64

Below, I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement.

**What Is Lifecycle Investing?**

Lifecycle investing, by Ayres and Nalebuff, argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth (including future earnings) is much larger than their current savings. Since most young investors have little capital available for investment, but decades of future earnings, they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans. As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal, you should gradually reduce risk.

How to do this:

* First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share.
* Use leverage through either margin, leveraged ETFs, or deep-in-the-money LEAPs
* Reduce leverage over time, shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bonds/real-estate and cash as retirement nears.

**My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation**
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can’t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I’ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn’t offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF’s trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do). 

**Plan**

* Quarterly Recalculation:

   * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share.
   * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s.

1. De-leverage Schedule:

   * Ages 27–30: Maintain 2x leverage.
   * Ages 30–40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase.
   * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation.
   * Ages 50–59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real-estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches.

So, for context, I’m from Spain and almost 30. I started investing around two years ago, when I didn’t really know how it worked. My biggest investment was my current house, which I bought for around 200,000€, and I’ve also put some money into the stock market sporadically (around 3,000€ total), investing in the classics like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Coca-Cola, by buying individual stocks through Revolut, not funds or ETFs.

>>>>>>> Stashed changes

**Risk Management and Contingencies**

* Time decay: I’ll monitor the LEAP’s theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage.
* Market extremes: If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence. 
* Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal.



**Summary**

I’m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 27 year old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I’ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ljrhwt/leveraging_my_roth_ira_through_lifecycle/

1. Allocate 10-15% of my portfolio to cash.

ACHR, as a prominent electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft developer, is aiming to transform urban air mobility through its flagship aircraft, Midnight. Built  for short, frequent flights of 20–50 miles, Midnight aircraft is nearing its commercial rollout following a handful of regulatory approvals and strategic partnerships ACHR has signed lately.

In June 2025, Archer Aviation signed a strategic partnership with Jetex to develop infrastructure at the latter’s network of private terminals for facilitating Midnight jet’s upcoming commercial air taxi operations. The partnership will initially concentrate on facilities in the United Arab Emirates, with plans to scale across Jetex’s broader portfolio of 40 private terminals in more than 30 countries worldwide.

Prior to this, ACHR joined U.S. and international regulators to launch a five-nation alliance aimed at streamlining global certification and deployment of its Midnight eVTOL aircraft.

With flight testing already underway and certification efforts in progress, the Midnight jet remains well-positioned to take-off smoothly, further supported by the aforementioned strategic moves undertaken by ACHR.

I know that they are fundamentally inefficient, because the amount spent on them could simply be reimbursed as a dividend giving the investors more choice - but I still find them fascinating. My interest in this concept grew when I saw how widespread they are in Japan, with companies offering free meals, gym memberships, and even lounges in malls for owning their stock.

However, aside from Japan, it is very rare that stocks do offer any kind of benefit other than growth and dividends - at most they offer a negligible discount, or in rare cases cruise ship companies offering onboard credit - for which you obviously still need to spend money on the cruise itself.

Recently, though, I found a super unique shareholder benefit that has NEVER been mentioned on reddit, and wanted to share it with you - as well as ask if you have any similar interesting benefits. Melia Hotels from Spain, offers different loyalty cards for their hotels depending on the amount of shares. And for the modest holding of 10000 shares (roughly 70000€) they offer the highest status.

The platinum card, apparently gives you free room upgrades, lounge access in hotels, welcome gifts, early check-in and late check-out, and most interestingly to me 2 visits in airport lounges per year (according to some sources, others said you get unlimited lounge visits at airports, but I am not sure). Yes, I know the cost of these would be marginal, since a lounge visit costs like 30-50€, but I found it interesting that it is the only non-Japan stock that offers a benefit for ""100%"" free. (Although I guess you still have to book a flight - but thats not related to them).

If anybody has similar stock benefits, I would love to hear about them. Oh - and I know about the 3kg Lindt chocolate you get, but you do need a Swiss adress. I wish they did international shipping, or at least within Europe. I mean, I also wish I had 130,000 Franks to invest in them but thats another story...",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ljjwjr/cool_unknown_shareholder_benefits/
2025-06-24 19:03:33,"Eutelsat opens new station in Angola, advancing its digitalization goals","Completion of the structure could serve as an economic multiplier for the region through reliable connectivity services

The Eutelsat Group has inaugurated a new satellite ground station in the Luanda-Bengo Special Economic Zone (EEZ) (Angola).

Eutelsat has an excellent reputation in Angola as a provider of geostationary satellite communications services and is looking to further expand its investment in the country. The company said the new ground station will carry its OneWeb low-Earth orbit (LEO) network to Angola and the wider Central African region.

“This ground station represents another step in the transformation of digital inclusion in Africa,” said Eutelsat-OneWeb Regional Director. “It underscores our commitment to bridging the connectivity gap and supporting the continent’s socio-economic development.”

Investment in the Luanda-Bengo ground station amounts to $15 million (R$82.7 million) in capital expenditure, with ongoing operating costs expected to reach $5 million (R$27.5 million) over the next decade, as part of a multi-year agreement with pan-African construction company Paratus Group. The station will contribute to the digitalization of public services such as schools, hospitals and government buildings.

Eutelsat celebrated the milestone as a step towards bridging the digital divide and driving inclusive economic growth. The station is the latest of several Eutelsat stations on the continent, along with other installations located in Mauritius, South Africa, Tanzania, Senegal and Ghana.

“The issuance of this license represents a monumental step forward in our mission to transform telecommunications,” said Amr Ashour, Senior Market Access Manager, Middle East and Africa, Eutelsat-OneWeb. “These state-of-the-art facilities will significantly improve connectivity, optimize data transmission and deliver significant benefits to metropolitan and rural areas across the African continent. We are honored to celebrate this milestone and look forward to an innovative future.”

Eutelsat is set to spin off its ground station infrastructure into a separate company after signing an $831 million sale and leaseback agreement with EQT late last year.

It is worth noting that Brazil has sought to increase and diversify its trade relations with Angola. After two terms in office in which trade between the countries was practically frozen, the Brazilian and Angolan governments intend to create opportunities beyond oil and agribusiness, the main pillars of joint business. In February 2023, Brazil and Angola signed cooperation agreements in areas such as tourism, education, health, agriculture, and exports. President Lula also inaugurated the Ovídio de Andrade Melo gallery in Luanda, a cultural center linked to the Itamaraty dedicated to Brazilian and Angolan art and culture. In addition, Brazil inaugurated the Consulate General of Brazil in Luanda, the country's capital, in February 2025, the country's only consulate general in Africa. Angola is home to the largest community of Brazilians in Africa, with approximately 30,000 people.

2025-06-24 14:14:55,US Consumer Confidence Drops on Broad Concerns About Economy,"Bloomberg) -- US consumer confidence unexpectedly declined in June on concerns about prospects for the economy, labor market and personal finances due to trade policy.

The Conference Board’s gauge of confidence decreased 5.4 points to 93, data showed Tuesday. The figure was below all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 

A measure of consumer expectations for the next six months dropped 4.6 points to 69, while a gauge of present conditions fell 6.4 points to 129.1.

The retreat in confidence erased nearly half of the prior month’s rebound, underscoring lingering anxiety about the potential impacts on the economy from higher US import duties. While inflation over the past three months has been modest, some consumers have become more guarded about their spending.

“Consumers were less positive about current business conditions than May. Their appraisal of current job availability weakened for the sixth consecutive month but remained in positive territory, in line with the still-solid labor market,” Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.

The cutoff date for the Conference Board survey was June 18, five days after Israel launched a series of strikes on Iranian targets. References to geopolitics increased only slightly in write-in responses, according to the survey.

The share of consumers expecting higher interest rates in the year ahead increased to 57%, the highest since October 2023, the Conference Board data showed. ",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ljc8dw/us_consumer_confidence_drops_on_broad_concerns/

**Recent analyst activity:**
Despite the slight dip, analysts are mostly leaning bullish:

HC Wainwright raised their PT to $18 (was $12)

Needham, Cantor, and Canaccord all sitting around $13

Average price target is now $13.13


**Earnings update:**
Last earnings beat expectations: -$0.17 vs est. -$0.21
They’re still burning cash (obviously it’s pre revenue), but institutional support remains strong. Hedge funds like Tidemark and Allworth have been quietly adding shares in recent months.

**Insider action:**
CTO and other execs have sold some shares, but nothing alarming. Still holding sizeable positions and no panic exits.

**And now Adam’s tweet:**
This was the real gem. AG dropped a tweet saying eVTOLs won’t just change traffic they’ll change how we think about time, access, even lifestyle. It’s giving “this isn’t just a product, it’s a platform” vibes.

He’s clearly pushing the narrative beyond “flying taxis” and into long term infrastructure/lifestyle disruption.


ACHR TLDR:
Price: $10.04
52W Range: $4.04 - $12.04
Market Cap: ~$5.5B
Average PT: $13.13
Sentiment: quietly bullish

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

Although the articles states ""The company’s ticker symbol will change from “CSLR” and “CSLRW” to “SPWR” and “SPWRW”, respectively, effective April 22, 2025"" the SPWR symbol still seems to be going: https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SPWR:NASDAQ

Also SunPower has regained Nasdaq compliance, reporting Q1 profits, being it's first profitable quarter in three years, and to returning solar panel and installation sales: https://www.pv-magazine.com/2025/05/06/sunpower-regains-nasdaq-compliance-reports-q1-profit/.

With this news, could Robinhood or other brokerages reactivate the SunPower trading? Once all the Nasdaq re-filling kinks are worked out. Those lingering $0.0001 shares look a bit out in my portfolio, lol.

I also found this trading symbol change notice in https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=55054  that *""SunPower Corporation (SPWR) will change its trading symbol to SPWRQ effective August 16, 2024, dueto the listing of the company on an OTC market. As a result, option symbol SPWR will change to SPWRQ effective at the opening of business on August 16, 2024.""* Again, August 2024 has come and gone and the SPWRQ stock hasn't budged.

However, one redditor stated: ""Equity owners (shareholders) are typically wiped out in bankruptcies. All the asset sales are going to the creditors."" - https://www.reddit.com/r/SunPower/comments/1g6mo5r/what_to_do_with_sunpower_stock/lskcr2p/

Ok, fair enough, if it's gone, it's gone, built I would like to get some clarity what's going on, if possible. The fact that the ""new"" SPWRQ stock is still $0.0001 means Complete Solaria rebranding/takeover hasn't completed?

There are no indicators we have a bad labor market at the moment or on the horizon and it's highly probable gdp will be positive this quarter after a bad q1.

Federal reserve most likely will cut rates in fall which will stimulate the economy which is a good indicator that gdp won't drop significantly.

Snap acquired Saturn, a social calendar app popular with students. Saturn reaches 80% of U.S. high schoolers, boosting Snap’s teen market dominance.

1.  Teen Engagement: Saturn’s integration may increase time spent on Snapchat, as teens open it 30+ times daily.

2.  Global Reach: With 443M daily users, Snap grows fastest in India (36% of users). Saturn could expand to similar markets.

3.  Monetization: Ad revenue hit $1.37B in Q3 2024; Saturn’s data could refine ad targeting. Snapchat+ (9M subscribers) may add Saturn features.

4.  AR/AI: Saturn could leverage Snap’s AR and AI for interactive scheduling, keeping teens hooked.


Snap struggles to retain older users but has strategies:

1.  Evolving Needs: Saturn’s tools for college and young adults could retain users transitioning to work.

2.  Feature Growth: Stories, Memories, and Snapchat+ cater to maturing users; Saturn adds utility.

3.  Competition: Snapchat competes with Instagram and TikTok but excels in authenticity. Saturn’s niche strengthens its edge.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lgdj52/snap_acquires_sature_social_calendar/

2025-06-20 14:54:49,US Prepares Action Targeting Allies’ Chip Plants in China (WSJ),"By Liza Lin, Amrith Ramkumar and Raffaele Huang

(Wall Street Journal) -- A U.S. official told top global semiconductor makers he wanted to revoke waivers they have used to access American technology in China, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could inflame trade tensions.

Currently, South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing enjoy blanket waivers that allow them to ship American chip-making equipment to their factories in China without applying for a separate license each time.

Jeffrey Kessler, head of the unit in charge of export controls at the Commerce Department, told the three companies this week he wanted to cancel those waivers, according to people familiar with the meetings. They said Kessler described the action as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on critical U.S. technology going to China.

If carried out, the move could be disruptive both diplomatically and economically. Earlier this month, the U.S. and China agreed to a fragile trade truce in London. Part of the deal involved each country agreeing to hold off from introducing new export controls and other measures designed to hurt the other.

The action isn't a new trade escalation but would be designed to make the licensing system for chip equipment similar to what China has in place for rare-earth materials, White House officials said. The U.S. and China continue to make progress on completing the agreement they reached in London and negotiating on trade, they said.

""Chip makers will still be able to operate in China. The new enforcement mechanisms on chips mirror licensing requirements that apply to other semiconductor companies that export to China and ensure the United States has an equal and reciprocal process,"" a Commerce Department spokesman said.

A new step making it harder for global chip makers to operate in China might still strike Beijing as a betrayal of the London deal. It could also strain the relationship between Washington and friendly governments in South Korea and Taiwan, whose companies would be most affected and have promised large investments in the U.S. in recent years.

The Chinese factories in question -- including a Samsung memory-chip factory in the Chinese city of Xi'an -- are part of the global supply chain for memory, logic and other chips. While they generally don't have the most advanced technology, the factories' output is widely used in cars, consumer electronics and the like.

Industry officials said tighter curbs by Washington wouldn't immediately force the factories to shut down, but over time, they could find it harder to operate effectively. That would disrupt global industry as companies are dealing with other issues triggered by the U.S.-China trade war, such as China's limits on exports of rare-earth magnets.

The chip makers would likely seek case-by-case licenses from the U.S. government to supply their Chinese factories, while looking to replace U.S. equipment with alternatives from Japan and Europe.

People involved in the discussions said revoking the waivers isn't a done deal.

They said Kessler's unit -- the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security -- hasn't secured buy-in from other parts of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Department. Opponents in the administration worry eliminating the waivers would ultimately end up boosting Chinese companies and give China control of the plants.

Kessler and other national-security hawks have taken a hard line on cutting off China from American technologies, arguing that aggressive measures are needed to limit the country's advances in critical sectors and spur development of supply chains outside China. Those efforts have put them in conflict with pro-business officials.

In recent weeks, the administration has halted sales to China of more high-end chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. That has dented the U.S. companies' revenue by billions of dollars. Commerce also weighed broad restrictions on sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, although a White House official said that move was no longer under consideration.

The South Korean and Taiwanese companies have notified authorities in their home regions about the waiver issue, hoping for help lobbying against the move, people familiar with the discussions said.

Both South Korea and Taiwan are negotiating broader trade deals with Washington, part of a wave of agreements the Trump administration hopes to wrap up in the coming weeks.

The companies see their Chinese factories as important for competing against Chinese rivals, which are looking to win more global business as chip suppliers. Samsung's current U.S. waiver has allowed its Xi'an plant to make some advanced products that compete against China's Yangtze Memory Technologies, among others.

South Korea, a U.S. military ally, and Taiwan have worked with the U.S. in its technology race with China, including by limiting transfer of advanced technology to China. TSMC, Samsung and SK Hynix have all made multibillion-dollar investments in U.S. factories with backing from Washington.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lg60qm/us_prepares_action_targeting_allies_chip_plants/

2025-06-20 13:51:15,Tesla Robotaxi Launch: We Were All Wrong (and VW has one now),"I made a speculative post about how Phony Stark would delay the Robotaxi launch and there were lots of other good guesses on how they would fake it (ala- human in a robot suit tactics). We had things like relays back to HQ to operate them like drones, tail cars, AI (actually Indians), and other ways humans would operate them. Well... It looks like they are going to go through with it and it's even worse than we all thought. They are just going to put a human operator inside the cars! Not kidding...

Source: [https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/](https://electrek.co/2025/06/20/tesla-releases-details-robotaxi-launch-safety-monitor-front-seat/)

I am going to need to see a picture of the passenger side floorboard. If they don't put a physical brake pedal in there like all the drivers ed cars have retrofitted in them, you know the human operator will have something like a game controller or button on them to apply the brakes. Classic Elon and Tesla.

Given that the only people riding in these Roboscams are known Tesler fanboys that were invited because of their past posts on X, I am sure the reviews will be nothing short of fantastic. Here is one I can foresee:

""*I felt perfectly safe riding in the awesome new Tesla Robotaxi! The ride was so smooth. I barely felt the bump when we ran over the little kid getting off the school bus and it didn't delay my trip at all after the AI just kept us going.*""

In other news: VW, without feeling the need to spread propaganda ahead of time, just unveiled their production ID. Buzz AD robotaxi. Yeah. That small car company. And it's awesome.

Source: [https://www.carscoops.com/2025/06/autonomous-id-buzz-ad-is-ready-to-battle-tesla-and-waymo/](https://www.carscoops.com/2025/06/autonomous-id-buzz-ad-is-ready-to-battle-tesla-and-waymo/)

Along with being an actual purpose design and built robotaxi instead of just a Jerrry-rigged older model, it has three things Tesla doesn't:

1. Nine LiDAR sensors (and five radars- so it doesn't crash into things).
2. Space for actual passengers- a key feature to taxis.
3. Level 4 autonomy.

I love the Tesla fan perspective on LiDAR: ""It's expensive"" and ""It's not needed with an AI-driven 100% vision system"". Yeah right. Let's see it work then. We've only been waiting a decade now. If Tesla can solve all of the world's hardest technological problems and are the world's best at manufacturing (as Elon states), then why can't they design and build their own simple LiDAR sensors for their cars? They can't make a better version of the sensor I can buy online for a few hundred bucks that goes into a golf range finder but they are going to make a humanoid robot? One of those things is really hard to do. The other isn't.

Tesla is so far behind in this space. I can't believe there are still enough gullible people still falling for the narrative to pump the stock. Their own internal analysis said this endeavor would lose money. At this point I think there are only three types of people:

1. Aware.
2. Blind Believers (aka- cult members).
3. Traders that are aware of the believers and make money off the stock because of them.",reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1lg4ifl/tesla_robotaxi_launch_we_were_all_wrong_and_vw/
